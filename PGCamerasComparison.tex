\section{Introduction}

The well-defined range of particles in matter is the main reason they are used in cancer treatment today. Unfortunately we are not able to take full advantage of this property, because of uncertainties in patient positioning, the proton range, patient anatomy, and the Hounsfield unit to particle stopping power conversion \citep{Paganetti2012}. Often, medical practice is to plan conservatively, namely adding margins around the tumor, greatly reducing the potential benefits of particle treatment \citep{Knopf2013}. Online monitoring would make measurements of uncertainties such as mentioned above possible, and thereby permit more precise planning which could take maximum advantage of the steep BP fall-off and reduce damage to tissues surrounding the tumor. A new way to perform monitoring is to use prompt gammas (PGs), a natural byproduct in particle treatments and are of prime interest \citep{Moteabbed2011,Gueth2013,Golnik2014a,Janssen2014}. A knife-edge PG camera \citep{Perali2014,Richter2016} was put into clinical operation in fall 2015, at OncoRay in Dresden, Germany. The aim of such collimated cameras is to obtain a 1D profile of the PG production along the beam direction and obtain the position of the fall-off of the signal, which is strongly correlated to the BP position. Other approaches include detection of the target materials using a spectral PG camera \citep{Verburg2014}, using the primary particle's time of flight (ToF) in a timed PG measurement \citep{Golnik2014a} and Compton camera designs \citep{Roellinghoff2011,Kurosawa2012,Solevi2016,Thirolf2016,Polf2015,Llosa2016}.

To date two publications have attempted to perform an in-depth comparison between two collimated PG camera designs. \cite{Smeets2016} showed an experimental comparison of the knife-edge camera with a non-optimized CLaRyS MPS camera (some technical constraints prevented the authors to use the \enquote{optimal CLaRyS design}. In \cite{Lin2017} a MC comparison is executed on their own two collimator designs. Although the aforementioned studies may give the impression to provide a fair comparison (use of the same absorbers, same beam-collimator and collimator-absorber distance in the case of \cite{Lin2017}), they do not provide a thorough justification of their sets of parameters. Surprisingly, some parameters are even not the same between the two camera types. While it can be understood in \cite{Smeets2016} due to experimental constraints, it is more questionable in \cite{Lin2017} (different energy deposition selection).

While very interesting, such comparisons could be supported by more theoretical considerations on the expected output and camera parameters. Taking a step back, the 1D PG signal can be paramatrized, as well as the relevant dimensions of the PG collimator, the event selection criteria. A simple model could be built relating these factors which in turn can be tested in a study.

This publication will demonstrate and validate a model for a knife-edge slit (KES) and multiparallel slit (MPS) collimator designs, both analytically and by using Monte Carlo (MC) studies. The objectives of the present paper are the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop an analytical model based on geometric considerations
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item The model should allow for a theoretical estimation of the detection efficiency and spatial resolution, for both MPS and KES and so allow for conclusions to be drawn about the intrinsic features of MPS and KES collimators.
    \item Validate the analytical model using MC studies.
    \item Address deficiencies in previous studies. In \cite{Smeets2016} and \cite{Lin2017}: the KES/MPS detection efficiency ratio is 1.6 for Smeets 2016 and 5.3 for Lin 2017, assuming the use of the same energy window\todo{was it the same energy window?}\answ{I think so. Certainly for Smeets 2016}. These comparisons were not performed under identical conditions, nor were differences accounted for.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Prototype comparison
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item The clinically relevant parameter is, currently, the fall-off position (FOP), allowing for a BP verification. The prototypes will thus be compared on that merit.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Analytical model for spatial resolution and detection efficiency}

Camera performance is mainly characterized by a compromise between spatial
resolution and detection efficiency. During camera design, modifications of some
geometrical parameters, such as collimator-crystal distance, collimator pitch or
depth\dots, often lead to improvement of one of this criteria and deterioration
of the other. In order to compare performance of different camera types
and configurations, we derive an analytical model that predict camera
performance for both Multi Parallel Slit (MPS) and Knife Edge Slit (KES) collimators. Such models allow to estimate variation
in performance according to variation in geometrical parameters assuming that the camera absorber allows for a perfect gamma detection (full absorption on absorber entrance surface). The models will
be evaluated against Monte-Carlo simulations in next sections. 

Figure~\ref{fig:CamerasParameters} and Table~\ref{table:CamerasParameters} first defines several generic geometrical parameters.

\subsubsection{Spatial resolution}

\newcommand\FOV{\textrm{Res}\,}
\newcommand\MPS{\textrm{MPS}}
\newcommand\KES{\textrm{KES}}
%\newcommand\du{\textrm{du}}
\newcommand\du{}
\newcommand\DE{\textrm{Eff}\,}

From a geometrical point of view, the spatial resolution is characterized by the
\textit{detector unit field of view}, denoted $\FOV_{\du}$. This is the portion of
the source that can be seen through a single camera unit: a single slit for the
MPS and a single detector unit for KES. The probability of a photon emitted at a
given point along a linear source perpendicular to the slit plane to reach
this detector unit can be described as an isosceles trapezoid whose width of the top segment corresponding to the slit width while the width of the base segment is equal to the sum of the slit width and the penumbra. We defined $\FOV_{\du}$
as the FWHM of this trapezoid, see eq~\ref{eq:fov_mps} and \ref{eq:fov_kes}.

\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:fov_mps}
  \FOV_{\du}^{\MPS} & = & s\left(1+ \frac{d_1}{D}\right) = p(1-f) \frac{D+d_1}{D} \\
  \label{eq:fov_kes}
   \FOV_{\du}^{\KES} & = & s\left(1+ \frac{d_1^{'}}{d_2^{'}}\right) = \frac{sL}{d_2^{'}}
\end{eqnarray}

If collimator transparency is neglected, $\FOV_{\du}$ is fully defined by
geometrical parameters, in particular the slit width $s$. However, prompt gamma
have high penetration capability that can not be neglected in the
case of KES where the collimator depth is very small in the region of the knife edge around the slit. Indeed, we define the \textit{Effective Slit Opening} $s_e$ that can be used in the evaluation of the field of view and the efficiency in place of the geometrical slit width. Metzler et al.~\cite{Metzler2005}
proposed a method to estimate the effective slit width, specifically to calculate
the spatial resolution accurately. The proposed expressions were based on
one-dimensional cuts through the pinhole geometry and can be applied directly to
a knife-edge geometry without modification. Their approach is for a point source
and dependent on the location of the source within the \FOV. For a source in the
center, it simplifies to eq.~\ref{eq:se} with $\mu$ the linear attenuation
length of the radiation in the collimator material.

\begin{eqnarray}
  s_e & = & s + \frac{\ln2}{\mu\tan\alpha}   \label{eq:se} \\
   \FOV_{\du}^{\KES} & = & s_e\left(1+ \frac{d_1^{'}}{d_2^{'}}\right) = \frac{s_eL}{d_2^{'}}          
  \label{eq:fov_kes_se}
\end{eqnarray}

Hence, eq.~\ref{eq:fov_mps} and eq.~\ref{eq:fov_kes_se} represent the spatial
resolution of the two KES and MPS camera systems according to simple geometrical and gamma attenuation parameters (collimator distances, angle and collimator linear attenuation length). The spatial resolution is expressed in millimeters. 

\subsubsection{Detection efficiency}

The probability that a photon emitted from a point facing a slit to reach the
detector is described by the solid angle $\Omega\,_D$ from that point to the
detector. For MPS, the solid angle is composed of the azimuthal angle
and the polar angle. With small angle approximation, it is described by
eq.\ref{eq:solid_angle_mps}. Note that this is true only when the $\Omega\,_D$ is
limited by the slit width, i.e. the crystal sizes and distances are such that
all photons that cross the collimator impinge on detector material. For KES, the
solid angle under which a point of the source sees a crystal of the detector
depends on the location of the point source, $x$, since the distance between source
and crystal changes significantly over the field of view of the camera. We
consider the solid angle for a point of the source that is within the central
part of the field of view of the crystal at location $x$ on the detector plane
(the origin of the detector plane facing the center of the slit). Under small
angle approximation, the solid angle is given eq.~\ref{eq:solid_angle_kes}.

\begin{align}  
  \Omega\,_D^{\MPS} & = \frac{H}{L} \frac{s}{D+d_1} \label{eq:solid_angle_mps} \\
	\Omega\,_D^{\KES} & = \frac{H L p'}{\Lambda^3(x)} =  \frac{H p'}{L^2 \left( 1+\frac{x^2}{d_2^{'2}} \right)^{3/2}} \label{eq:solid_angle_kes} 
\end{align}
with $\Lambda$ the distance between the source point and the crystal in the KES.

We consider that a detection unit correspond to a single detector. The
corresponding detection efficiency, denoted $\DE_{\du}$, can be expressed as:
$\DE_{\du} = \textrm{GDE} \times f_{\textrm{FOV}}$, with $\textrm{GDE}$ the geometrical
detection efficiency with the solid angle of a point that sees a detector
through the slit, and $f_{\textrm{FOV}} = \frac{\FOV_{\du}}{p}$ the FOV factor
where $p$ is the pitch of the camera (in practice the width of the detector
unit). This FOV factor corresponds to the fraction of the source seen by the
camera. It is in principle larger than 1 since cameras are usually designed to
see all the source without any hidden regions. The detection efficiency per
detector unit is then given by eq.~\ref{eq:de_mps} and~\ref{eq:de_kes}.

\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:de_mps}
  \DE_{\du}^{\MPS} & = & \frac{\Omega\,_D^{\MPS}}{4\pi} \frac{\FOV_{\du}^{\MPS}}{p} \nonumber\\
                & = & \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{H}{L} \frac{s}{D+d_1} p(1-f)
                      \frac{D+d_1}{D} \frac{1}{p} \nonumber\\
                & = & \frac{Hs(1-f)^2}{4 \pi L D}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:de_kes}
	\DE_{\du}^{\KES} & = & \frac{\Omega\,_D^{\KES}}{4\pi} \frac{\FOV_{\du}^{\KES}}{p'} \nonumber\\
	& = & \frac{s_e H}{4\pi d_2^{'} L} \frac{1}{\left( 1+\frac{x^2}{d_2^{'2}}\right)^{3/2}}
\end{eqnarray}


% As a conclusion, spatial resolution of MPS and KES camera are given by
% eq.~\ref{eq:fov_mps} and \ref{eq:fov_kes_se}, and detection efficiency are given
% eq.~\ref{eq:de_mps} and \ref{eq:de_kes}. Other non geometrical parameters, such
% as type of crystal, energy thresholds or TOF thresholds are also important and
% will be discussed later. The next section describes the Monte-Carlo simulations that have been
% performed to evaluate this analytical model and a comparison between MPS and KES
% systems.

The formulas of detection efficiency and spatial resolution of MPS and KES cameras are gathered in table~\ref{table:AMformulas}. The most striking feature of theses formulas is their similarities. Indeed if we consider perfect collimators with infinite absorption capacity then the effective slit width of the KES ($s_e$) is equal to $s$ and the filling factor $f$ of the MPS can be decreased down to zero. In such conditions, \answ{TO BE COMPLETED by Etienne}

\subsection{Monte Carlo simulations}
\label{sec:MC}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Analytical model verification (AMV): Fair comparison of the two types of collimators with MC simulations. What does it mean? 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use of same absorbers (the LYSO absorber of the KES prototype that we can consider as the reference), the same energy selection which was not the case in Lin 2017 and the same TOF selection (no TOF)
    \item Then a discussion of the results in the light of the analytical models
    \item Note: the KES background level can be obtained from Figure 18 in
      Perali 2014. Regarding the MPS background level I propose to use the same
      level as the one of KES for the following reasons: i)
      the background level in the MPS camera is derived in Pinto 2014 from measurements with large detectors by assuming that the background is proportional to the detector volume. If we apply the same approach, it is reasonable to use the same background levels since we use the same absorbers for MPS and KES. One can argue that the MPS and KES collimators are different. It is true and it is difficult to say whether the larger amount of material in the CLaRyS MPS collimator leads to a larger background with more neutron-induced gammas or a lower background due to a larger attenuation of these gammas\dots At first order the background levels should be similar and a first order estimate is sufficient for a paper that mainly aims at comparing the signal detection of the two cameras.
  \end{itemize}    
  \item Simulations of the two prototypes as they are published (results of the submitted paper with the \enquote{regular} cylindrical PMMA target of 15 cm diameter and 20 cm lenght). 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\Rightarrow$ Comparison of the two prototypes
    \item Note that the absorbers have different thicknesses
  \end{itemize}     
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Simulation tool}\label{sec:SimTool}

Imaging paradigms such as PG detection are evaluated against experiments, and often also with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations~\citep{Moteabbed2011,Gueth2013,Robert2013,Golnik2014a,Janssen2014}. For rarely occurring processes such as PG simulation, convergence to the model of the truth to within acceptable statistical error can be slow. This paper presents an \emph{in silico} study of the feasibility of the clinical relevance of PG FOP estimation using collimated cameras, and uses the vpgTLE variance reduction method described in \cite{Huisman2016}. vpgTLE is a two stage process, where firstly a PG yield distribution image is estimated, which in the second stage is used as a PG source with which  can be investigated. Gate 7.2~\citep{Sarrut2014} with Geant 4.10.02 and the QGSP\_BIC\_HP\_EMY physics list, commonly used for PG studies, are used in this analysis. Thanks to vpgTLE, simulations for about $10^9$ protons (about $6\times10^8$ photons) took 1-2 hours on a single core of an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3740QM.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{PG Camera modeling}\label{sec:camera}

Two PG detectors tailored to FOP verification (illustrated in fig.~\ref{fig:detectors}) were chosen:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item the CLaRyS multi-parallel-slit (MPS) camera, Case 1 \citep{Pinto2014a}
\item[] This camera intends to measure the whole PG profile to control ion-ranges in the patient with a field of view (FoV) of 300 mm. It consists of a bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) absorber and a tungsten alloy collimator. It makes use of ToF selection to reduce the neutron background. In the optimization carried out by \cite{Pinto2014a}, parameters such as collimator pitch, axis-to-collimator and axis-to-detector were varied, and their impacts evaluated in terms of fall-off retrieval precision (FRP) and spatial resolution (sharpness of the fall-off region). Here, configuration 1 (with relaxed constraints on spatial resolution) was chosen for its optimal FRP performance. As was done by \cite{Pinto2014a}, the camera lengths (collimator and scintillator volume) are chosen \emph{up to} 300 mm, such that the length is an integer multiple of the pitch size, with for the collimator a collimator-leaf-width extra, to ensure each pixel has a leaf on both sides. With the 8 mm pitch and 2.6 mm collimator-leafs, this results in a scintillator volume of length 296 mm and collimator length 298.6 mm.
\item the IBA knife-edge slit (KES) camera \citep{Perali2014,Sterpin2015}
\item[] The purpose of this camera consists of verifying the BP position with a FoV of 100 mm. It consists of a Cerium doped Lutetium based (LYSO) absorber and a tungsten alloy collimator.\cite{Richter2016} provides the first clinically obtained results. At this time, no other camera has been subjected to clinical tests, which is why we consider this prototype a benchmark.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{detectors_cyl}
  \caption{Schematic presentation of the two PG cameras considered in this study. The green arrow represents the proton beam. In red the collimation elements and in blue detection elements. The dimensions were taken from \cite{Pinto2014a} and \cite{Perali2014,Sterpin2015}. Note that the two cameras have an identical detector height ($\odot$ symbol), the two cameras were positioned at an identical location above the head during all simulations, and that here they are not drawn to scale.}
  \label{fig:detectors}
\end{figure}

Regarding background ToF selection, for the IBA C230 accelerator with a period of 10 ns, \cite{Pinto2014a} chose a window of 4 ns around the PG maximum, based on experimental ToF spectra. This means that about 60\% of the noise could be removed. For the KES prototype ToF is not used, leading to a higher background, as is evident when one compares the backgrounds as published in the two publications. A second difference is the energy selection window. The IBA group employ a 3-6 MeV window, whereas the CLaRyS collaboration produced their optimization with a 1-8 MeV window. We will compare each camera with their published properties, that is to say: a 1-8 MeV window and ToF for MPS and a 3-6 MeV window without ToF for KES.

Both PG camera prototypes have different photodetectors and different detector electronics. In this study, these differences are not implemented. Instead, the method as described in \cite{Gueth2013} was used to obtain the interaction point of an impinging photon. If the integrated energy deposited in a crystal lies in the acceptable energy and ToF window, the event is recorded. The position of the event in the crystal is considered as the energy weighed barycenter of all interactions in the crystal, plus a random value taken from a 5mm FWHM Gaussian to simulate the electronics and the detector resolution.

\subsubsection{Background modeling}

Background estimation in PG simulation is a difficult and largely unsolved issue \citep{Huisman2016,Sterpin2015,Pinto2014a,Perali2014}. Simulations would ideally include beam nozzle and whole room modeling, but these are habitually omitted. ToF selection techniques can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \citep{Testa2008,Roellinghoff2014a}, but then depend on the proper simulation of the beam accelerator time structure. As noted in \cite{Huisman2016}, no validation for background in PG simulations has been performed at this time. In this study, the stable time structure of current generation cyclotrons was assumed, in which the neutron background is largely constant. 

Estimates of background counts in the detector are taken from \cite{Pinto2014a,Perali2014}, which are both based on measured data:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item MPS: \cite{Pinto2014a} fig.~9: $1 \cdot 10^{3} \pm 1 \cdot 10^{2}$ per $4\cdot10^9$ primary protons per 8 mm bin
\item[] Converted to per primary proton: $2.5 \cdot 10^{-7} \pm 0.25 \cdot 10^{-7}$
\item KES: \cite{Perali2014} fig.~11: $5 \cdot 10^{-7} \pm 0.5 \cdot 10^{-7}$ per primary proton per 4 mm bin
\end{itemize}

Per unit of bin length, the background yield of the MPS with ToF is therefore 4 times as low as the background seen with the KES. In the context of the fair comparison, for the KES camera the background with ToF can be obtained by multiplying the background with the same $\frac{4 ns}{10 ns} = 0.4$ fraction as with the MPS. For the AMV, the background will be left out, as only PG detection was modelled.

\subsubsection{Beam and target}

We use the test-case presented in \cite{Perali2014} as the KES detector properties such as background were published for that scenario, again in order to remove any doubt that a difference in camera performance could be due to a difference in implementation or setup. A 160 MeV mono-energetic proton beam is shot into a cylindrical PMMA phantom (length 30 cm, radius 15 cm). Employing the batch method we realize 50 simulations for each experiment.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{AMV-specific alterations to setup}

% Since we are using a simulation for the validation of the theoretical expressions in table~\ref{GeomFormulas}, for the fairest comparison possible, we can equalize certain aspects which might cause one camera or the other to give favorable impression. In principle this comparison is not about absorption materials, acquisition electronics or PG selections, but PG collimator characteristics. So, for the validation of the expressions in table~\ref{GeomFormulas} and comparison on LCE, SR and FRP we set the absorber material of the MPS to that of the KES: LYSO. The energy and ToF selection windows are kept identical for both cameras, and are varied in order to study their impact on the figures of merit.

In the case of simulation for analytical model verifications, we use identical absorbers for both prototypes, namely the absorber of the KES prototype and we apply the same energy and TOF selection: the same energy selection ($E> 1$~MeV) and the same TOF selection (no TOF selection). Since AMV deals with gamma detection, no background modeling is applied in this AMV-specific setup. \todo{To be modified according to Table~\ref{table:CameraParameters} which is up to date.}

Table~\ref{table:CameraParameters} gives an overview of the main cameras parameters used for AMV and prototypes comparison.

% The previous paragraph refers to the verification of our simulations and data analysis by comparing the FOP with the results published in Perali, right ? It is presented in Appendix
%, each resulting in a FOP estimate, giving us a mean $\upmu_\textrm{FOP}$ and a standard deviation $\upsigma_\textrm{FOP}$ for a certain experiment. Since we are studying the effect of replacing the CT with a RPCT to simulate patient change, we run each experiment with both CT and RPCT. Each FOP estimate of the N CT realizations is compared to each FOP estimate of the N RPCT realizations, resulting in N$\times$N possible \emph{FOP shift} measurements. These distributions have a $\upmu_\Delta$ and a $\upsigma_\Delta$. The shift initially obtained with the dose is denoted $\Delta_\textrm{dose}$


% Grading the performance of the detectors will be done according to these figures of merit: 

%\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
%\item Accuracy: $| \upmu_{\Delta} - \Delta_\textrm{dose}|$.
%\item Precision: $\upsigma_\Delta$. For this estimate of the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution a standard deviation can be computed once again based on the number of realization $n$ used to obtain it: $\upsigma(\upsigma_\Delta)=\frac{\upsigma_\Delta}{\sqrt{2\times(n-1)}}$, as per \citet[formula 4.54]{Leo1994}.
%\item Confidence: the percentage of RPCT FOP realizations that fall outside $\upmu_\textrm{FOP,CT}\pm2\upsigma_\textrm{FOP,CT}$ indicates the likelihood any difference from the expected FOP is measured. In other words, given that in this analysis we know that a shift should be detected, what is the probability that a particular realization does so? It will be denoted as P$_\Delta$.

\subsubsection{Analytical Model Verification}

The comparison of the analytical model with Monte Carlo simulations will performed on the two features predicted by the model, namely the detection efficiency and the spatial resolution

\paragraph{Detection efficiency}

The detection efficiency can be defined as the ratio of the mean number of detected gammas over the number of emitted gammas for camera units seeing the PG profile.
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item the detection efficiency of a camera unit defined as the ratio of the mean number of detected gammas over the number of emitted gammas for camera units seeing the PG profile,
% 	\item the PG falloff contrast (FOC), which we define as the difference between peak and background, normalized by the number of primaries and per millimeter (since the two cameras have differing bin sizes).
% \end{itemize}
% The two quantities are strongly correlated. The former directly corresponds to the definition of the anaytical detection efficiency $DE_{cu}$ the latter accouts for the partial collimator transparency and it is the camera endpoint in the context of ion-range verification.

\paragraph{Spatial resolution}

Let us define the width of the PG profile fall-off ($FOW$) as the FWHM of the peak resulting from the computation of the PG profile first derivative.

The $FOW$ of the detected PG profiles can be obtained in principle using summation in quadrature of the $FOW$ of PG emission profiles ($FOW_\text{e}$) and the spatial resolution of the cameras (Res). Since $FOW_\text{e}\sim5$~mm according to simulated profiles \citep{Krimmer2017a} and Res of the MPS and KES prototypes ranges from 10 to 20~mm \citep{Pinto2014a, Smeets2012}, we can consider that $FOW$ is mainly determined by the camera spatial resolution (Res). 


\subsubsection{Prototype Comparison}

In the comparison of the nominal (unequalized) prototypes, we also take a look at the figures of merit (summarized in table~\ref{table:FOM}). In addition, because of its clinical relevance, the fall-off retrieval precision ($FRP$) will be determined. The FRP is the standard deviation of the FOP, which is obtained by way of the batch method. Each of these can then be examined as function of the energy and ToF selections.



Table~\ref{table:FOM} presents the figures of merit used for the analytical model verification and the prototypes comparison.

\end{figure}  

Table~\ref{tab:AMV} compares the detection efficiency and the spatial resolution obtained from the analytical model and Monte Carlo simulations. Since the model does not explicitly deal with collimator transparency or absorber efficiency, we compare the AM to a Monte Carlo simulation with perfect absorber and collimator. Because such conditions are unphysical, results with a physical collimator and physical absorber are shown for the spatial resolution and detection efficiency respectively.

% The FOW shown in table~\ref{FOWCOMP} shows that both cameras perform similar with ToF selection. For the MPS the ToF selection makes no difference (up to 2\%), while for the KES it gives a 10-20\% improvement. The results are a bit worse than the calculated values in table~\ref{GeomFormulas}, but close to the 20 mm as postulated in \cite{Priegnitz2015}.

When we make the collimator perfectly absorbing (any tracks entering the collimator material are killed), we observe the KES's effective slit width in action: the transmission through the collimator creating a wider $s_e$ is gone and we see the FOW decrease between 40 and 100\%. This is roughly in line with the calculated $s_e$: \textcolor{red}{ETIENNE?} Surprisingly the FOW of the KES approaches the theoretical value nearly, while the MPS is still a few millimeters worse than calculated. 

\answ{Table~\ref{tab:AMV} 1) We have in principle 4 combinations with real/perfect collimator and real/perfect absorber. I propose to use only two configuration for each measurement (Res and Eff). Res: real/perfect collimator with perfect absorber to see the influence of collimator transparency on Res. Eff: real/perfect absorber with perfect collimator to see the influence of the absorber intrinsic efficiency on the camera efficiency. 2) The discrepancy between the KES efficiencies obtained with AM and MC ($1.06 \cdot 10^{-3}$  vs $7.54\cdot10^{-4}$) has still to be understood.}

\section{Fall-off position and width estimation procedure}\label{sec:fopproc}

\subsection{Fall-off position estimation procedure}

From a clinical perspective, the range estimate could be more interesting than FOP, because it can distinguish simple offset errors from patient morphological change. While the MPS camera was conceived for whole range PG profile detection, the KES camera FoV was chosen for BP region PG detection only. To make the comparison fair, only the FOP could be considered. Multiple approaches to extracting a FOP from the line profile have been proposed \citep{Smeets2012,Gueth2013,Roellinghoff2014a,Janssen2014,Sterpin2015}. In preparatory work, a number of the proposed procedures were investigated. Significant sensitivity to free parameters on the final FOP estimates were seen. In summary, the FOP estimate depends greatly on the procedure, and often on having yields uncommon on the spot-level in clinical TPs, and also on an absence of unavoidable inhomogeneities.

Therefore the fitting method was not chosen as a topic for study in this paper. Instead, a simple method that works on most the data available to the authors was used: first a smoothed and interpolated spline function is fitted against the detected PG data points, after which a baseline and (distal) peak position are determined. The intersection of the spline with the half-height of the peak above the baseline is then taken as the FOP. A more detailed description of the procedure may be found in appendix~\ref{sec:fopproc}.


\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item The measured PG profile is smoothed and interpolated with a smoothing spline function:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat f(x_i))^2 + \lambda \int_{x_1}^{x_n} \hat f''(x)^2 \,dx
\end{equation}

where $y_i$ is the measured PG profile and $x_i$ the associated x-coordinates, $\hat f(x_i)$ the estimate smoothed spline function and $\lambda$ a smoothing parameter that determines the penalty for deviating from measurement in exchange for smoothness (second order derivatives are close to zero on smooth functions). $\lambda = 0$ produces a perfect spline fit to the data, while $\lambda \gg 1$ produces a horizontal line. We found that $\lambda = 2$ provided an acceptable trade-off between overfitting to noise and removing too many features, which tends to happen for low statistic measurements.
\item The obtained function is plotted for 1024 $x_j$, an number that provided a sufficiently high resolution. Any $f(x_j) < 0$ are set to $0$. 
\item The global maximum is found.
\item The baseline is set equal to the lowest 25\% of bins.
\item From the distal end backwards, the first maximum is taken as the distal most peak position, if it is above the threshold of 30\% of the difference between baseline and global maximum. If no such point is found, the global maximum is taken as the distal most maximum.
\item The fall-off amplitude (FOA) is set to the difference between the distal maximum and baseline: $FOA = max-baseline$. The FOP is obtained by traversing the smoothed profile from the distal end towards the peak until $y_j > \frac{1}{2}FOA$.
\end{enumerate}

The results of this procedure are illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:our-fit}. Every PG profile was estimated 50 times, and so we obtained 50 estimates for the FOP. It is assumed that the FOPs follow a Gaussian distribution, so the mean of the 50 realizations gives the best FOP estimate and the sigma gives the precision of the ability to estimate the best FOP. Comparing the 50 FOP estimates obtained from the CT with the 50 estimates obtained from the RPCT simulations, gives 2500 possible shift estimates. Again, the distribution of shifts should be centered at the true shift, while the sigma indicates how likely it is that this true shift is detected under the current conditions.

The smoothed data is shown in red. The green horizontal lines are drawn at the obtained distal maxima and baselines, while the vertical green lines shown the position of the distal maximum and the position of the fall-off. For the bottom-right plot, a history is visible where the procedure fails: the background induces an erroneous peak detection.}

  \caption{\label{FOWILLUS} MPS and KES FOW estimation illustrated.}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{FOWILLUS} shows and illustration of the procedure for two selected profiles obtained with each collimator. To estimate the fall-off with FOW, we smooth the profile in a similar manner as for the FOP estimation, as detailed in appendix~\ref{sec:fopproc} (row 1 in fig.~\ref{FOWILLUS}). Then, a first and second order derivative is computed. On the first order derivative, a Gaussian is fitted (dashed line on second row), on the interval (solid line) between the profile maximum (Bragg Peak) and the first inflection point past the FOP on the second order derivative (here the 1D PG profile is at the baseline of the background, see third row). The Gaussian is fit with a fixed offset of zero, because the baseline of the background is zero. The full width half max of the fitted Gaussian is then taken as the FOW (second row).

\section{Verification of the cameras}

In \cite{Priegnitz2015} PG shifts due to beam energy shifts are studied for the KES camera: the \emph{detectability} of the fall-off as function of the number of primaries. Here that simulation was recreated: a mono-energetic beam shoots into a waterbox at two energies. 50 realizations are generated with a 139 MeV beam energy, and 50 realizations with 144 MeV. At $10^9$ primaries, the distributions are well separated with a shift of 8.3 mm (different from \cite{Priegnitz2015} because of the different material). In figure 13 in \cite{Perali2014} with $10^9$ primaries a standard deviation of 1.5 mm is obtained, while here 1.21 and 1.14 mm were obtained. It is sufficient agreement to be confident of our setup and further results.

The KES prototype's sensitivity to accurate positioning with respect to the expected FOP was elaborated upon in \citet[Section IV.A.3]{Sterpin2015}: the detector response is, due to the KES collimator, not linear as with a parallel slit collimator. In this study, to make the comparison as fair as possible and avoid any bias, alignment on the FOP specific for each spot was ensured as follows: the intermediate PG source image of vpgTLE (equivalent to the PG emission) was projected on the beam axis, and then convolved with a Gaussian of $\upsigma = 8.5$ mm, which corresponds to the point spread function (PSF) with a FWHM of 20 mm used in \cite{Priegnitz2015} to approximate the detected profiles from the emitted profile. These profiles will be referred to as "PG + PSF" profiles. As a matter of fact, the MPS prototype has roughly the same PSF as the KES prototype so that "PG + PSF" fall-off position can be considered as the expected position for both cameras.

To verify the implementation of the MPS camera, the precision on the FOP, obtained with the procedure outlined in the previous paragraph, is compared to earlier results. In the caption of figure 9 in \cite{Pinto2014a} it is stated that with $10^8$ primaries a standard deviation of 1.3 mm is obtained for the detector design used here, which is about 20\% different from the results obtained in this study: 1.63 and 1.54 mm.
