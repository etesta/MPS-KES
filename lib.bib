abstract = {To account for photon penetration, the formulae used to calculate the geometric resolution of a pinhole collimator use an effective diameter d(e) rather than the physical diameter of the aperture. The expressions commonly used for d(e), however, were originally derived to include penetration in sensitivity calculations. To predict the full width at half maximum (FWHM) resolution of the point-spread function (PSF) of a knife-edge pinhole collimator, we have previously proposed simple expressions for a resolution-effective diameter d(re). Unlike those for d(e), expressions for d(re) predict both a dependence on the polar angle of the source (theta) and a non-isotropic PSF. In this paper, the new theory was tested by measuring experimentally the FWHM of the PSF. Results confirm the theoretical predictions that (a) d(re) provides the best estimates of the experimental FWHM as a function of theta and of the direction in the plane of the pinhole, (b) Paix's expression for d(e) tends to overestimate the FWHM, (c) Anger's is a better approximation, but still cannot predict the dependence on theta, and (d) the FWHM decreases with decreasing theta, i.e. resolution improves for sources at the edge of the field-of-view.},

abstract = {The Monte Carlo (MC) method has been shown through many research studies to calculate accurate dose distributions for clinical radiotherapy, particularly in heterogeneous patient tissues where the effects of electron transport cannot be accurately handled with conventional, deterministic dose algorithms. Despite its proven accuracy and the potential for improved dose distributions to influence treatment outcomes, the long calculation times previously associated with MC simulation rendered this method impractical for routine clinical treatment planning. However, the development of faster codes optimized for radiotherapy calculations and improvements in computer processor technology have substantially reduced calculation times to, in some instances, within minutes on a single processor. These advances have motivated several major treatment planning system vendors to embark upon the path of MC techniques. Several commercial vendors have already released or are currently in the process of releasing MC algorithms for photon and/or electron beam treatment planning. Consequently, the accessibility and use of MC treatment planning algorithms may well become widespread in the radiotherapy community. With MC simulation, dose is computed stochastically using first principles; this method is therefore quite different from conventional dose algorithms. Issues such as statistical uncertainties, the use of variance reduction techniques, the ability to account for geometric details in the accelerator treatment head simulation, and other features, are all unique components of a MC treatment planning algorithm. Successful implementation by the clinical physicist of such a system will require an understanding of the basic principles of MC techniques. The purpose of this report, while providing education and review on the use of MC simulation in radiotherapy planning, is to set out, for both users and developers, the salient issues associated with clinical implementation and experimental verification of MC dose algorithms. As the MC method is an emerging technology, this report is not meant to be prescriptive. Rather, it is intended as a preliminary report to review the tenets of the MC method and to provide the framework upon which to build a comprehensive program for commissioning and routine quality assurance of MC-based treatment planning systems.},

abstract = {Compton-based prompt gamma (PG) imaging has been proposed for in vivo range verification in proton therapy. However, several factors degrade the image quality of PGs, some of which are due to inherent properties of a Compton camera such as spatial resolution and energy resolution. Moreover, Compton-based PG imaging has a spatially variant resolution loss. In this study, we investigate the performance of the list-mode ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with a shift-variant point spread function model (LM-OSEM-SV-PSF). We also evaluate how well the PG images reconstructed using a SV-PSF model reproduce the distal falloff of the proton beam. SV-PSF parameters were estimated by simulation data of point sources at various positions. Simulated PGs were produced in a water phantom irradiated with a proton beam. Compared to the LM-OSEM algorithm, the LM-OSEM-SV-PSF algorithm improved the quality of the reconstructed PG images and the estimation of PG falloff positions. In addition, the 4.44 and 5.25 MeV PG emissions can be accurately reconstructed using the LM-OSEM-SV-PSF algorithm. However, for the 2.31 and 6.13 MeV PG emissions, the LM-OSEM-SV-PSF reconstruction provides limited improvement. We also found that the LM-OSEM algorithm followed by a shift-variant Richardson-Lucy deconvolution could reconstruct images with quality visually similar to the LM-OSEM-SV-PSF reconstructed images while requiring shorter computation time.},

abstract = {The $\gamma$-index dose comparison tool has been widely used to compare dose distributions in cancer radiotherapy. The accurate calculation of $\gamma$-index requires an exhaustive search of the closest Euclidean distance in the high-resolution dose-distance space. This is a computational intensive task when dealing with 3D dose distributions. In this work, we combine a geometric method (Ju et al 2008 Med. Phys. 35 879-87) with a radial pre-sorting technique (Wendling et al 2007 Med. Phys. 34 1647-54) and implement them on computer graphics processing units (GPUs). The developed GPU-based $\gamma$-index computational tool is evaluated on eight pairs of IMRT dose distributions. The $\gamma$-index calculations can be finished within a few seconds for all 3D testing cases on one single NVIDIA Tesla C1060 card, achieving 45-75× speedup compared to CPU computations conducted on an Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz processor. We further investigated the effect of various factors on both CPU and GPU computation time. The strategy of pre-sorting voxels based on their dose difference values speeds up the GPU calculation by about 2.7-5.5 times. For n-dimensional dose distributions, $\gamma$-index calculation time on CPU is proportional to the summation of $\gamma$(n) over all voxels, while that on GPU is affected by $\gamma$(n) distributions and is approximately proportional to the $\gamma$(n) summation over all voxels. We found that increasing the resolution of dose distributions leads to a quadratic increase of computation time on CPU, while less-than-quadratic increase on GPU. The values of dose difference and distance-to-agreement criteria also have an impact on $\gamma$-index calculation time.},

abstract = {The gamma-evaluation method is a tool by which dose distributions can be compared in a quantitative manner combining dose-difference and distance-to-agreement criteria. Since its introduction, the gamma evaluation has been used in many studies and is on the verge of becoming the preferred dose distribution comparison method, particularly for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) verification. One major disadvantage, however, is its long computation time, which especially applies to the comparison of three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions. We present a fast algorithm for a full 3D gamma evaluation at high resolution. Both the reference and evaluated dose distributions are first resampled on the same grid. For each point of the reference dose distribution, the algorithm searches for the best point of agreement according to the gamma method in the evaluated dose distribution, which can be done at a subvoxel resolution. Speed, computer memory efficiency, and high spatial resolution are achieved by searching around each reference point with increasing distance in a sphere, which has a radius of a chosen maximum search distance and is interpolated "on-the-fly" at a chosen sample step size. The smaller the sample step size and the larger the differences between the dose distributions, the longer the gamma evaluation takes. With decreasing sample step size, statistical measures of the 3D gamma distribution converge. Two clinical examples were investigated using 3% of the prescribed dose as dose-difference and 0.3 cm as distance-to-agreement criteria. For 0.2 cm grid spacing, the change in gamma indices was negligible below a sample step size of 0.02 cm. Comparing the full 3D gamma evaluation and slice-by-slice 2D gamma evaluations ("2.5D") for these clinical examples, the gamma indices improved by searching in full 3D space, with the average gamma index decreasing by at least 8%.},

Previous work has detailed the development of an EPID based in-vivo dosimetry system that was subsequently used to replace pre-treatment dose verification of IMRT and VMAT plans. Here we show that this system can be readily implemented on a commercial megavoltage imaging platform without modification to EPID hardware and without impacting standard imaging procedures. The accuracy and practicality of the EPID in-vivo dosimetry system was confirmed through a comparison with traditional TLD in-vivo measurements performed on five prostate patients.The commissioning time required for the EPID in-vivo dosimetry system was initially prohibitive at approximately 10 h per linac. Here we present a method of calculating linac specific EPID dosimetry correction factors that allow a single energy specific commissioning model to be applied to EPID data from multiple linacs. Using this method reduced the required per linac commissioning time to approximately 30 min.The validity of this commissioning method has been tested by analysing in-vivo dosimetry results of 1220 patients acquired on seven linacs over a period of 5 years. The average deviation between EPID based isocentre dose and expected isocentre dose for these patients was (-0.7  ±  3.2)%.EPID based in-vivo dosimetry is now the primary in-vivo dosimetry tool used at our centre and has replaced nearly all pre-treatment dose verification of IMRT treatments.},

abstract = {The majority of radiation treatment planning problems are relatively straightforward, involving only specified gantry angles in a treatment plane which is perpendicular to the patient longitudinal axis. In addition, there are a number of more complex three-dimensional problems which require combined rotation of the gantry, collimator, and turntable for their solutions. These include, for example, the use of non-coplanar fields and oblique treatment planes, the matching of field edges in three dimensions, the treatment of the breast with opposing tangential fields, and the treatment of inclined elongated lesions. Unfortunately, there is no general systematic approach to the solution of these more complex problems. One may attempt an analytic solution, but this approach is often too cumbersome and tedious. On the other hand, one may resort to a "trial and error" session with the simulator. This paper, therefore, presents a mathematical method which is easily applied and applicable to a wide variety of complex three-dimensional treatment planning problems. The method considers the gantry, collimator, and turntable as coordinate systems. These coordinate systems are derivable from each other by specified coordinate transformations, which contain the rotation angles of the gantry, collimator, and turntable. Within this mathematical framework, the treatment planning problems are found to reduce to two general types, of which various clinical examples are then given.},

abstract = {The commissioning of a three-dimensional treatment planning system requires comparisons of measured and calculated dose distributions. Techniques have been developed to facilitate quantitative comparisons, including superimposed isodoses, dose-difference, and distance-to-agreement (DTA) distributions. The criterion for acceptable calculation performance is generally defined as a tolerance of the dose and DTA in regions of low and high dose gradients, respectively. The dose difference and DTA distributions complement each other in their useful regions. A composite distribution has recently been developed that presents the dose difference in regions that fail both dose-difference and DTA comparison criteria. Although the composite distribution identifies locations where the calculation fails the preselected criteria, no numerical quality measure is provided for display or analysis. A technique is developed to unify dose distribution comparisons using the acceptance criteria. The measure of acceptability is the multidimensional distance between the measurement and calculation points in both the dose and the physical distance, scaled as a fraction of the acceptance criteria. In a space composed of dose and spatial coordinates, the acceptance criteria form an ellipsoid surface, the major axis scales of which are determined by individual acceptance criteria and the center of which is located at the measurement point in question. When the calculated dose distribution surface passes through the ellipsoid, the calculation passes the acceptance test for the measurement point. The minimum radial distance between the measurement point and the calculation points (expressed as a surface in the dose–distance space) is termed the $\gamma$ index. Regions where $\gamma$>1 correspond to locations where the calculation does not meet the acceptance criteria. The determination of $\gamma$ throughout the measured dose distribution provides a presentation that quantitatively indicates the calculation accuracy. Examples of a 6 MV beam penumbra are used to illustrate the $\gamma$ index.},

abstract = {The $\gamma$ tool was developed to quantitatively compare dose distributions, either measured or calculated. Before computing $\gamma$, the dose and distance scales of the two distributions, referred to as evaluated and reference, are renormalized by dose and distance criteria, respectively. The renormalization allows the dose distribution comparison to be conducted simultaneously along dose and distance axes. The $\gamma$ quantity, calculated independently for each reference point, is the minimum distance in the renormalized multidimensional space between the evaluated distribution and the reference point. The $\gamma$ quantity degenerates to the dose-difference and distance-to-agreement tests in shallow and very steep dose gradient regions, respectively. Since being introduced, the $\gamma$ quantity has been used by investigators to evaluate dose calculation algorithms, and compare dosimetry measurements. This manuscript examines the $\gamma$ distribution behavior in two dimensions and evaluates the $\gamma$ distribution in the presence of data noise. Noise in the evaluated distribution causes the $\gamma$ distribution to be underestimated relative to the no-noise condition. Noise in the reference distribution adds noise in the $\gamma$ distribution in proportion to the normalized dose noise. In typical clinical use, the fraction of points that exceed 3% and 3 mm can be extensive, so we typically use 5% and 2–3 mm in clinical evaluations. For clinical cases, the calculation time is typically 5 minutes for a 1×1 mm 2 interpolated resolution on an 800 MHz Pentium 4 for a 14.1×15.2 cm 2 radiographic film.},

abstract = {In IMRT, the method for a quantitative comparison of two-dimensional dose distributions is still under development. The gamma evaluation method proposed by Low et al is the most accepted approach and has been adapted by many groups. Based on the concept of Low et al we developed a software tool with an intelligent search algorithm to minimize the calculation time. For the interpretation of deviations a y angle distribution and other tools (dose difference map, profiles, y area histograms, etc) are integrated in the software package. Ten hybrid plans are included in the verification study containing 6 IMRT head and neck cases, 2 IMRT prostate cases and one IMRT paravertebral case as well as a standard uniform intensity conformal 4 field box treatment for comparison. IMRT plans are realized with a segmental MLC delivery technique. The fields of a hybrid plan are applied at once and dose distributions are measured with films in three planes of a verification phantom. All y vector calculations are based on a 3% dose criterion and a 3 mm DTA acceptance criterion. The mean value gamma(mean) (mean value in the y distribution) of the various IMRT plans is 0.45+/-0.10 (1 SD). On average, the percentage of points exceeding the acceptance criteria of gamma < or = 1 (gamma > 1) is 5.8+/-5.4% (1 SD). The mean value of gamma 1% (1% of points have an equal or higher gamma value) is 1.47+/-0.59 (1 SD) for IMRT plans. In 5 out of 27 planes, gamma > 1 is substantially larger than the average. This is also indicated in gamma area histograms. Planes with large areas outside the tolerance criteria were further evaluated using gamma angle distributions. This additional information indicates that the large areas with high gamma values are dominated by the dose difference. It is shown that the deviations are influenced by tongue and groove effects. From the statistical evaluation of gamma values (e.g. gamma area histogram), acceptance criteria for IMRT hybrid plans can be defined. For the interpretation of the gamma maps, distributions of the gamma angle and traditional evaluation methods, such as dose profiles, are still very useful.},

abstract = {Agreement between planned and delivered dose distributions for patient-specific quality assurance in routine clinical practice is predominantly assessed utilizing the gamma index method. Several reports, however, fundamentally question current IMRT QA practice due to poor sensitivity and specificity of the standard gamma index implementation. An alternative is to employ dose volume histo-gram (DVH)-based metrics. An analysis based on the AAPM TG 53 and ESTRO booklet No.7 recommendations for QA of treatment planning systems reveals deficiencies in the current " state of the art " IMRT QA, no matter which metric is selected. The set of IMRT benchmark plans were planned, delivered, and analyzed by following guidance of the AAPM TG 119 report. The recommended point dose and planar dose measurements were obtained using a PinPoint ionization cham-ber, EDR2 radiographic film, and a 2D ionization chamber array. Gamma index criteria {3% (global), 3 mm} and {3% (local), 3 mm} were used to assess the agreement between calculated and delivered planar dose distributions. Next, the AAPM TG 53 and ESTRO booklet No.7 recommendations were followed by dividing dose distributions into four distinct regions: the high-dose (HD) or umbra region, the high-gradient (HG) or penumbra region, the medium-dose (MD) region, and the low-dose (LD) region. A different gamma passing criteria was defined for each region, i.e., a " divide and conquer " (D&C) gamma method was utilized. The D&C gamma analysis was subsequently tested on 50 datasets of previously treated patients. Measured point dose and planar dose distributions compared favorably with TG 119 benchmark data. For all complex tests, the percentage of points pass-ing the conventional {3% (global), 3 mm} gamma criteria was 97.2% ± 3.2% and 95.7% ± 1.2% for film and 2D ionization chamber array, respectively. By dividing 2D ionization chamber array dose measurements into regions and applying 3 mm isodose point distance and variable local point dose difference criteria of 7%, 15%, 25%, and 40% for HD, HG, MD, and LD regions, respectively, a 93.4% ± 2.3% gamma passing rate was obtained. Identical criteria applied using the D&C gamma technique on 50 clinical treatment plans resulted in a 97.9% ± 2.3% gamma passing score. Based on the TG 119 standard, meeting or exceeding the benchmark results would indicate an exemplary IMRT QA program. In contrast to TG 119 analysis, a different scrutiny on the same set of data, which follows the AAPM TG 53 and ESTRO booklet No.7 guidelines, reveals a much poorer agreement between calcu-lated and measured dose distributions with large local point dose differences within different dose regions. This observation may challenge the conventional wisdom that an IMRT QA program is producing acceptable results.

abstract = {The $\gamma$-index dose comparison tool has been widely used to compare dose distributions in cancer radiotherapy. The accurate calculation of $\gamma$-index requires an exhaustive search of the closest Euclidean distance in the high-resolution dose-distance space. This is a computational intensive task when dealing with 3D dose distributions. In this work, we combine a geometric method (Ju et al 2008 Med. Phys. 35 879-87) with a radial pre-sorting technique (Wendling et al 2007 Med. Phys. 34 1647-54) and implement them on computer graphics processing units (GPUs). The developed GPU-based $\gamma$-index computational tool is evaluated on eight pairs of IMRT dose distributions. The $\gamma$-index calculations can be finished within a few seconds for all 3D testing cases on one single NVIDIA Tesla C1060 card, achieving 45-75× speedup compared to CPU computations conducted on an Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz processor. We further investigated the effect of various factors on both CPU and GPU computation time. The strategy of pre-sorting voxels based on their dose difference values speeds up the GPU calculation by about 2.7-5.5 times. For n-dimensional dose distributions, $\gamma$-index calculation time on CPU is proportional to the summation of $\gamma$(n) over all voxels, while that on GPU is affected by $\gamma$(n) distributions and is approximately proportional to the $\gamma$(n) summation over all voxels. We found that increasing the resolution of dose distributions leads to a quadratic increase of computation time on CPU, while less-than-quadratic increase on GPU. The values of dose difference and distance-to-agreement criteria also have an impact on $\gamma$-index calculation time.},

abstract = {Methods to calibrate Megavoltage electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) for dosimetry have been previously documented for dynamic treatments such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using flattened beams and typically using integrated fields. While these methods verify the accumulated field shape and dose, the dose rate and differential fields remain unverified. The aim of this work is to provide an accurate calibration model for time dependent pre-treatment dose verification using amorphous silicon (a-Si) EPIDs in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for both flattened and flattening filter free (FFF) beams. A general calibration model was created using a Varian TrueBeam accelerator, equipped with an aS1000 EPID, for each photon spectrum 6 MV, 10 MV, 6 MV-FFF, 10 MV-FFF. As planned VMAT treatments use control points (CPs) for optimization, measured images are separated into corresponding time intervals for direct comparison with predictions. The accuracy of the calibration model was determined for a range of treatment conditions. Measured and predicted CP dose images were compared using a time dependent gamma evaluation using criteria (3+ACU-, 3 mm, 0.5 sec). Time dependent pre-treatment dose verification is possible without an additional measurement device or phantom, using the on-board EPID. Sufficient data is present in trajectory log files and EPID frame headers to reliably synchronize and resample portal images. For the VMAT plans tested, significantly more deviation is observed when analysed in a time dependent manner for FFF and non-FFF plans than when analysed using only the integrated field. We show EPID-based pre-treatment dose verification can be performed on a CP basis for VMAT plans. This model can measure pre-treatment doses for both flattened and unflattened beams in a time dependent manner which highlights deviations that are missed in integrated field verifications.},

abstract = {The gamma index ($\gamma$) is one of the most commonly used metrics for the verification of complex modulated radiotherapy. The mathematical definition of the $\gamma$ is computationally expensive and various techniques have been reported to speed up the calculation either by mathematically refining the $\gamma$ or employing various computational techniques. These techniques can cause variation in output with different software implementations. The $\gamma$ has traditionally been used to compare a 2D measured plane against a 2D or 3D dose distribution. Recently, software algorithm and hardware improvements have led to the possibility of using measured 2D data from commercial detector arrays to reconstruct a 3D-dose distribution and perform a volumetric comparison against the treatment planning system (TPS). A limitation in this approach is that commercial detector arrays have so far been limited by their spatial resolution which may affect the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D volume and subsequently the $\gamma$ calculation. Additionally, 3D versus 3D $\gamma$ comparison adds a layer of complication in the calculation of the $\gamma$ given the increase in the number of calculation points and the result cannot be as easily interpreted in the same way as 2D comparison. This review summarises and highlights the computational challenges of the $\gamma$ calculation and sheds light on some of these issues by means of a bespoke MATLAB software to demonstrate the impact of interpolation, $\gamma$ search distance, resolution and 2D and 3D calculations. Finally, a recommendation is made on the minimum information that should be reported when publishing $\gamma$ results.},

abstract = {A method to convert integrated electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images to fluence for the purpose of reconstructing the dose to a phantom is investigated here for simple open fields. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a method to reconstruct the dose to patients. The EPID images are transformed into incident intensity fluence by spatial filtering with a deconvolution kernel. The kernel uses a general mathematical form derived from a Monte Carlo calculation of the point spread function of an EPID. The deconvolution kernel is fitted using a downhill search algorithm that minimizes the difference between the reconstructed dose and the dose measured in water. The beam profile "horns" that are removed by the EPID calibration procedure are restored to the resulting images by direct multiplication using the measured in-air off-axis ratio. Applying the fitted kernel to an EPID image provides the incident fluence for that beam. This beam fluence is then entered into an independent dose calculation algorithm for phantom or patient dose reconstruction. The phantom dose was computed to an accuracy of 2.0% of the dmax dose at one standard deviation. The method is general and can possibly be applied to any EPID equipped with an integration mode. We demonstrate the application of the fitted kernel in two clinical IMRT cases.},

abstract = {The $\gamma$ tool was developed to quantitatively compare dose distributions, either measured or calculated. Before computing $\gamma$, the dose and distance scales of the two distributions, referred to as evaluated and reference, are renormalized by dose and distance criteria, respectively. The renormalization allows the dose distribution comparison to be conducted simultaneously along dose and distance axes. The $\gamma$ quantity, calculated independently for each reference point, is the minimum distance in the renormalized multidimensional space between the evaluated distribution and the reference point. The $\gamma$ quantity degenerates to the dose-difference and distance-to-agreement tests in shallow and very steep dose gradient regions, respectively. Since being introduced, the $\gamma$ quantity has been used by investigators to evaluate dose calculation algorithms, and compare dosimetry measurements. This manuscript examines the $\gamma$ distribution behavior in two dimensions and evaluates the $\gamma$ distribution in the presence of data noise. Noise in the evaluated distribution causes the $\gamma$ distribution to be underestimated relative to the no-noise condition. Noise in the reference distribution adds noise in the $\gamma$ distribution in proportion to the normalized dose noise. In typical clinical use, the fraction of points that exceed 3% and 3 mm can be extensive, so we typically use 5% and 2–3 mm in clinical evaluations. For clinical cases, the calculation time is typically 5 minutes for a 1×1 mm 2 interpolated resolution on an 800 MHz Pentium 4 for a 14.1×15.2 cm 2 radiographic film.},

abstract = {A method for the quantitative four-dimensional (4D) evaluation of discrete dose data based on gradient-dependent local acceptance thresholds is presented. The method takes into account the local dose gradients of a reference distribution for critical appraisal of misalignment and collimation errors. These contribute to the maximum tolerable dose error at each evaluation point to which the local dose differences between comparison and reference data are compared. As shown, the presented concept is analogous to the $\gamma$-concept of Low et al (1998a Med. Phys. 25 656–61) if extended to (3+1) dimensions. The pointwise dose comparisons of the reformulated concept are easier to perform and speed up the evaluation process considerably, especially for fine-grid evaluations of 3D dose distributions. The occurrences of false negative indications due to the discrete nature of the data are reduced with the method. The presented method was applied to film-measured, clinical data and compared with $\gamma$-evaluations. 4D and 3D evaluations were performed. Comparisons prove that 4D evaluations have to be given priority, especially if complex treatment situations are verified, e.g., non-coplanar beam configurations.},

abstract = {The commissioning of a three-dimensional treatment planning system requires comparisons of measured and calculated dose distributions. Techniques have been developed to facilitate quantitative comparisons, including superimposed isodoses, dose-difference, and distance-to-agreement (DTA) distributions. The criterion for acceptable calculation performance is generally defined as a tolerance of the dose and DTA in regions of low and high dose gradients, respectively. The dose difference and DTA distributions complement each other in their useful regions. A composite distribution has recently been developed that presents the dose difference in regions that fail both dose-difference and DTA comparison criteria. Although the composite distribution identifies locations where the calculation fails the preselected criteria, no numerical quality measure is provided for display or analysis. A technique is developed to unify dose distribution comparisons using the acceptance criteria. The measure of acceptability is the multidimensional distance between the measurement and calculation points in both the dose and the physical distance, scaled as a fraction of the acceptance criteria. In a space composed of dose and spatial coordinates, the acceptance criteria form an ellipsoid surface, the major axis scales of which are determined by individual acceptance criteria and the center of which is located at the measurement point in question. When the calculated dose distribution surface passes through the ellipsoid, the calculation passes the acceptance test for the measurement point. The minimum radial distance between the measurement point and the calculation points (expressed as a surface in the dose–distance space) is termed the $\gamma$ index. Regions where $\gamma$>1 correspond to locations where the calculation does not meet the acceptance criteria. The determination of $\gamma$ throughout the measured dose distribution provides a presentation that quantitatively indicates the calculation accuracy. Examples of a 6 MV beam penumbra are used to illustrate the $\gamma$ index.},

abstract = {The verification of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is necessary for adequate quality control of the treatment. Pretreatment verification may trace the possible differences between the planned dose and the actual dose delivered to the patient. To estimate the impact of differences between planned and delivered photon beams, a three-dimensional (3-D) dose verification method has been developed that reconstructs the dose inside a phantom. The pretreatment procedure is based on portal dose images measured with an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) of the separate beams, without the phantom in the beam and a 3-D dose calculation engine based on the Monte Carlo calculation. Measured gray scale portal images are converted into portal dose images. From these images the lateral scattered dose in the EPID is subtracted and the image is converted into energy fluence. Subsequently, a phase-space distribution is sampled from the energy fluence and a 3-D dose calculation in a phantom is started based on a Monte Carlo dose engine. The reconstruction model is compared to film and ionization chamber measurements for various field sizes. The reconstruction algorithm is also tested for an IMRT plan using 10 MV photons delivered to a phantom and measured using films at several depths in the phantom. Depth dose curves for both 6 and 10 MV photons are reconstructed with a maximum error generally smaller than 1% at depths larger than the buildup region, and smaller than 2% for the off-axis profiles, excluding the penumbra region. The absolute dose values are reconstructed to within 1.5% for square field sizes ranging from 5 to 20 cm width. For the IMRT plan, the dose was reconstructed and compared to the dose distribution with film using the gamma evaluation, with a 3% and 3 mm criterion. 99% of the pixels inside the irradiated field had a gamma value smaller than one. The absolute dose at the isocenter agreed to within 1% with the dose measured with an ionization chamber. It can be concluded that our new dose reconstruction algorithm is able to reconstruct the 3-D dose distribution in phantoms with a high accuracy. This result is obtained by combining portal dose images measured prior to treatment with an accurate dose calculation engine.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

The results of the GPU-based CCCS algorithm were compared to those of Monte Carlo simulations. The planned and EPID-based reconstructed dose distributions in overridden-to-water phantoms and the original patients were compared for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans based on dose differences and gamma analysis.RESULTS:The total single-field dose computation time was less than 8s, and the gamma evaluation for a 0.1-cm grid resolution was completed in approximately 1s. The results of the GPU-based CCCS algorithm exhibited good agreement with those of the Monte Carlo simulations. The gamma analysis indicated good agreement between the planned and reconstructed dose distributions for the treatment plans. For the target volume, the differences in the mean dose were less than 1.8%, and the differences in the maximum dose were less than 2.5%. For the critical organs, minor differences were observed between the reconstructed and planned doses.CONCLUSIONS:The GPU calculation engine was used to boost the speed of 3D dose and gamma evaluation calculations, thus offering the possibility of true real-time 3D dosimetric verification.},

These functions are being used in our clinic for prediction of portal dose images (PDIs) which are compared with PDIs measured with an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). The calculations are based on the planning CT-scan of the patient and on the irradiation geometry as determined in the treatment planning process. For each beam quality, the required input data for the algorithm for transmission prediction are derived from a limited number of measured beam data. The method has been tested for a PDI-plane at 160 cm from the focus, in agreement with the fixed focus-to-detector distance of our fluoroscopic EPIDs. For 6, 23 and 25 MV photon beams good agreement (approximately 1%) has been found between calculated and measured transmissions through anthropomorphic phantoms.},

abstract = {The problem of reconstructing incident radiotherapy beam profiles from electronic portal images recorded behind a phantom is addressed. To this end an iterative algorithm is presented, which is able to extract the input beam profile from a portal image by compensating for the attenuation of the beam and subtracting the amount of scatter emitted by the phantom. The algorithm requires only a thickness map of the phantom. Scatter is estimated using a superposition method based on precalculated Monte Carlo scatter kernels. The method is tested for a homogeneous water-equivalent slab phantom for simple rectangular and complex multileaf collimated fields. It is shown that the method produces a stable result within four iterations yielding an accuracy for the incident beam distribution of better than 3%.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: As external beam treatment plans become more dynamic and the dose to normal tissue is further constrained, treatments may consist of a larger number of beams, each delivering smaller doses (or monitor units, MU), in, e.g., volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Electronic portal imaging devices (EPID) may be used to verify external beam treatments on integrated fractions as well as in a more time dependent manner such as field by field. For treatment verification performed during a fraction (e.g., individual fields or VMAT control points), the lower limit of EPID measurement capability becomes important. The authors quantified the signal and timing accuracy of EPID images for low MU intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and conformal fields.\n\nMETHODS: EPID images were collected from three different vendor's accelerators for low MU fields and compared to expected images. Simulations were performed to replicate the EPID acquisition pattern and to enhance the understanding of EPID readout schemes.\n\nRESULTS: Large discrepancies between observed and predicted images were noted due to an under-response to single low MU fields. It is shown that a variability of up to 37% can be observed for low MU fields in clinically used EPID acquisition modes and that the majority of this variability can be accounted for by the readout scheme, integration, and timing of EPID acquisitions. Simulations have confirmed the causes of the discrepancies. The occurrence and extent of the variation has been estimated for clinical settings.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Incorrect absolute EPID signals collected for low MU fields in external beam treatments will negatively affect quantitative applications such as individual field based EPID dosimetry, typically appearing as an underdose, unless corrections to currently employed EPID readout schemes are made.},

abstract = {Electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) can be used to measure a two-dimensional (2D) dose distribution behind a patient, thus allowing dosimetric treatment verification. For this purpose we experimentally assessed the accuracy of a 2D portal dose prediction model based on pencil beam scatter kernels. A straightforward derivation of these pencil beam scatter kernels for portal dose prediction models is presented based on phantom measurements. The model is able to predict the 2D portal dose image (PDI) behind a patient, based on a PDI without the patient in the beam in combination with the radiological thickness of the patient, which requires in addition a PDI with the patient in the beam. To assess the accuracy of portal dose and radiological thickness values obtained with our model, various types of homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous phantoms were irradiated with a 6 MV photon beam. With our model we are able to predict a PDI with an accuracy better than 2% (mean difference) if the radiological thickness of the object in the beam is symmetrically situated around the isocenter. For other situations deviations up to 3% are observed for a homogeneous phantom with a radiological thickness of 17 cm and a 9 cm shift of the midplane-to-detector distance. The model can extract the radiological thickness within 7 mm (maximum difference) of the actual radiological thickness if the object is symmetrically distributed around the isocenter plane. This difference in radiological thickness is related to a primary portal dose difference of 3%. It can be concluded that our model can be used as an easy and accurate tool for the 2D verification of patient treatments by comparing predicted and measured PDIs. The model is also able to extract the primary portal dose with a high accuracy, which can be used as the input for a 3D dose reconstruction method based on back-projection.},

abstract = {Intensity modulated treatment plan optimization is a computationally expensive task. The feasibility of advanced applications in intensity modulated radiation therapy as every day treatment planning, frequent re-planning for adaptive radiation therapy and large-scale planning research severely depends on the runtime of the plan optimization implementation. Modern computational systems are built as parallel architectures to yield high performance. The use of GPUs, as one class of parallel systems, has become very popular in the field of medical physics. In contrast we utilize the multi-core central processing unit (CPU), which is the heart of every modern computer and does not have to be purchased additionally. In this work we present an ultra-fast, high precision implementation of the inverse plan optimization problem using a quasi-Newton method on pre-calculated dose influence data sets. We redefined the classical optimization algorithm to achieve a minimal runtime and high scalability on CPUs. Using the proposed methods in this work, a total plan optimization process can be carried out in only a few seconds on a low-cost CPU-based desktop computer at clinical resolution and quality. We have shown that our implementation uses the CPU hardware resources efficiently with runtimes comparable to GPU implementations, at lower costs.},

The results demonstrate adequate accuracy of our GPU implementation for both electron and photon beams in the radiotherapy energy range.

Over the past few years, GPU-based high-performance computing in radiotherapy has experienced rapid developments. A tremendous amount of study has been conducted, in which large acceleration factors compared with the conventional CPU platform have been observed.

abstract = {Introduction and purpose: Dosimetry Check (DC) (Math Resolutions) is a commercial EPID-based dosimetry software, which allows performing pre-treatment and transit dosimetry. DC provides an independent verification of the treatment, being potentially of great interest due to the high benefits of the in vivo volumetric dosimetry, which guarantee the treatment delivery and anatomy constancy. The aim of this work is to study the differences in dose between DC and the Treatment Planning System (TPS) to establish an accuracy level of the system. Material and methods: DC v.3.8 was used along with Varian Clinac iX accelerator equipped with EPID aS1000 and Eclipse v.10.0 with AAA and Acuros XB calculation algorithms. The DC evaluated version is based on a pencil beam calculation algorithm. Various plans were generated over several homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms. Isocentre point doses and gamma analysis were evaluated. Results: Total dose differences at the isocentre between DC and TPS for the studied plans are less than 2%, but single field contributions achieve greater values. In the presence of heterogeneities, the discrepancies can reach up to 15%. In transit mode, DC does not consider properly the couch attenuation, especially when there is an air gap between phantom and couch. Conclusions: The possibility of this in vivo evaluation and the potentiality of this new system have a very positive impact on improving patient QA. But improvements are required in both calculation algorithm and integration with the record and verify system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.},

abstract = {Purpose: To develop a method that reconstructs, independently of previous (planning) information, the dose delivered to patients by combining in-room imaging with transit dose measurements during treatment. Methods and Materials: A megavoltage cone-beam CT scan of the patient anatomy was acquired with the patient in treatment position. During treatment, delivered fields were measured behind the patient with an electronic portal imaging device. The dose information in these images was back-projected through the cone-beam CT scan and used for Monte Carlo simulation of the dose distribution inside the cone-beam CT scan. Validation was performed using various phantoms for conformal and IMRT plans. Clinical applicability is shown for a head-and-neck cancer patient treated with IMRT. Results: For single IMRT beams and a seven-field IMRT step-and-shoot plan, the dose distribution was reconstructed within 3%/3mm compared with the measured or planned dose. A three-dimensional conformal plan, verified using eight point-dose measurements, resulted in a difference of 1.3 ?? 3.3% (1 SD) compared with the reconstructed dose. For the patient case, planned and reconstructed dose distribution was within 3%/3mm for about 95% of the points within the 20% isodose line. Reconstructed mean dose values, obtained from dose-volume histograms, were within 3% of prescribed values for target volumes and normal tissues. Conclusions: We present a new method that verifies the dose delivered to a patient by combining in-room imaging with the transit dose measured during treatment. This verification procedure opens possibilities for offline adaptive radiotherapy and dose-guided radiotherapy strategies taking into account the dose distribution delivered during treatment sessions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Two collapsed cone (CC) superposition algorithms have been implemented for radiopharmaceutical dosimetry of photon emitters. The straight CC (SCC) superposition method uses a water energy deposition kernel (EDKw) for each electron, positron and photon components, while the primary and scatter CC (PSCC) superposition method uses different EDKw for primary and once-scattered photons. PSCC was implemented only for photons originating from the nucleus, precluding its application to positron emitters. EDKw are linearly scaled by radiological distance, taking into account tissue density heterogeneities. The implementation was tested on 100, 300 and 600 keV mono-energetic photons and (18)F, (99m)Tc, (131)I and (177)Lu. The kernels were generated using the Monte Carlo codes MCNP and EGSnrc. The validation was performed on 6 phantoms representing interfaces between soft-tissues, lung and bone. The figures of merit were $\gamma$ (3%, 3 mm) and $\gamma$ (5%, 5 mm) criterions corresponding to the computation comparison on 80 absorbed doses (AD) points per phantom between Monte Carlo simulations and CC algorithms. PSCC gave better results than SCC for the lowest photon energy (100 keV). For the 3 isotopes computed with PSCC, the percentage of AD points satisfying the $\gamma$ (5%, 5 mm) criterion was always over 99%. A still good but worse result was found with SCC, since at least 97% of AD-values verified the $\gamma$ (5%, 5 mm) criterion, except a value of 57% for the (99m)Tc with the lung/bone interface. The CC superposition method for radiopharmaceutical dosimetry is a good alternative to Monte Carlo simulations while reducing computation complexity.},

abstract = {In this work, an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (a-Si EPID) dose prediction model based on the energy fluence model of the Pinnacle treatment planning system Version 7 (Philips Medical Systems, Madison, WI) is developed. An energy fluence matrix at very high resolution (< 1 mm) is used to incorporate multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf effects in the predicted EPID images. The primary dose deposited in the EPID is calculated from the energy fluence using experimentally derived radially dependent EPID interaction coefficients. Separate coefficients are used for the open beam energy fluence component and the component of the energy fluence transmitted through closed MLC leaves to each EPID pixel. A spatially invariant EPID dose deposition kernel that describes both radiative dose deposition, central axis EPID backscatter, and optical glare is convolved with the primary dose. The kernel is further optimized to give accurate EPID penumbra prediction and EPID scatter factor with changing MLC field size. An EPID calibration method was developed to reduce the effect of nonuniform backscatter from the support arm (E-arm) in a calibrated EPID image. This method removes the backscatter component from the pixel sensitivity (flood field) correction matrix retaining only field-specific backscatter in the images. The model was compared to EPID images for jaw and MLC defined open fields and eight head and neck intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) fields. For the head and neck IMRT fields with 2%, 2 mm criteria 97.6 +/- 0.6% (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) of points passed with a gamma index less than 1, and for 3%, 3 mm 99.4 +/- 0.4% of points were within the criteria. For these fields, the 2%, 2 mm pass score reduced to 96.0 +/- 1.5% when backscatter was present in the pixel sensitivity correction matrix. The model incorporates the effect of MLC leaf transmission, EPID response to open and MLC leakage dose components, and accurately predicts EPID images of IMRT fields. Removing the backscatter component of the pixel sensitivity matrix correction reduces the effect of nonuniform E-arm backscatter.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate a formalism for transit dosimetry using a phantom study and prospectively evaluate the protocol on a patient population undergoing 3D conformal radiotherapy. Methods: Amorphous silicon EPIDs were calibrated for dose and used to acquire images of delivered fields. The measured EPID dose map was back-projected using the planning CT images to calculate dose at pre-specified points within the patient using commercially available software, EPIgray (DOSIsoft, France). This software compared computed back-projected dose with treatment planning system dose. A series of tests were performed on solid water phantoms (linearity, field size effects, off-axis effects). 37 patients were enrolled in the prospective study. Results: The EPID dose response was stable and linear with dose. For all tested field sizes the agreement was good between EPID-derived and treatment planning system dose in the central axis, with performance stability up to a measured depth of 18 cm (agreement within -0.5% at 10 cm depth on the central axis and within -1.4% at 2 cm off-axis). 126 transit images were analysed of 37 3D-conformal patients. Patient results demonstrated the potential of EPIgray with 91% of all delivered fields achieved the initial set tolerance level of ??D of 0 ?? 5-cGy or %??D of 0 ?? 5%. Conclusions: The in vivo dose verification method was simple to implement, with very few commissioning measurements needed. The system required no extra dose to the patient, and importantly was able to detect patient position errors that impacted on dose delivery in two of cases.},

abstract = {This study develops a method to improve the dosimetric accuracy of computed images for an amorphous silicon flat-panel imager. Radially dependent kernels derived from Monte Carlo simulations are convolved with the treatment-planning system's energy fluence. Multileaf collimator (MLC) beam hardening is accounted for by having separate kernels for open and blocked portions of MLC fields. Field-size-dependent output factors are used to account for the field-size dependence of scatter within the imager. Gamma analysis was used to evaluate open and sliding window test fields and intensity modulated patient fields. For each tested field, at least 99.6% of the points had gamma < 1 with a 3%, 3-mm criteria. With a 2%, 2-mm criteria, between 81% and 100% of points had gamma < 1. Patient intensity modulated test fields had 94%-100% of the points with gamma < 1 with a 2%, 2-mm criteria for all six fields tested. This study demonstrates that including the dependencies of kernel and fluence on radius and beam hardening in the convolution improves its accuracy compared with the use of radial and beam-hardening independent kernels; it also demonstrates that the resultant accuracy of the convolution method is sufficient for pretreatment, intensity modulated patient field verification.},

WatchDog is a novel application of EPIDs, in which the image frames acquired during treatment are used to monitor treatment delivery in real time. We report on the preliminary use of WatchDog in a prospective study of cancer patients undergoing intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and identify the challenges of clinical adoption. Methods and Materials At the time of submission, 28 cancer patients (head and neck, pelvis, and prostate) undergoing fractionated external beam radiation therapy (24 IMRT, 4 VMAT) had ???1 treatment fraction verified in real time (131 fractions or 881 fields). EPID images acquired continuously during treatment were synchronized and compared with model-generated transit EPID images within a frame time (???0.1 s). A ?? comparison was performed to cumulative frames to gauge the overall delivery quality, and the resulting pass rates were reported graphically during treatment delivery. Every frame acquired (500-1500 per fraction) was saved for postprocessing and analysis. Results The system reported the mean ?? standard deviation in real time ?? 91.1% ?? 11.5% (83.6% ?? 13.2%) for cumulative frame ?? analysis with 4%, 4 mm (3%, 3 mm) criteria, global over the integrated image.

Following introductory summaries on photon beam characteristics and clinical requirements on dose calculations, calculation methods are described in order of increasing explicitness of particle transport. The simplest are dose ratio factorizations limited to point dose estimates useful for checking other more general, but also more complex, approaches. Some methods incorporate detailed modelling of scatter dose through differentiation of measured data combined with various integration techniques. State-of-the-art methods based on point or pencil kernels, which are derived through Monte Carlo simulations, to characterize secondary particle transport are presented in some detail. Explicit particle transport methods, such as Monte Carlo, are briefly summarized. The extensive literature on beam characterization and handling of treatment head scatter is reviewed in the context of providing phase space data for kernel based and/or direct Monte Carlo dose calculations. Finally, a brief overview of inverse methods for optimization and dose reconstruction is provided.},

abstract = {A method for photon beam dose calculations is described. The primary photon beam is raytraced through the patient, and the distribution of total radiant energy released into the patient is calculated. Polyenergetic energy deposition kernels are calculated from the spectrum of the beam, using a database of monoenergetic kernels. It is shown that the polyenergetic kernels can be analytically described with high precision by (A exp( -ar) + B exp( -br)/r2, where A, a, B, and b depend on the angle with respect to the impinging photons and the accelerating potential, and r is the radial distance. Numerical values of A, a, B, and b are derived and used to convolve energy deposition kernels with the total energy released per unit mass (TERMA) to yield dose distributions. The convolution is facilitated by the introduction of the collapsed cone approximation. In this approximation, all energy released into coaxial cones of equal solid angle, from volume elements on the cone axis, is rectilinearly transported, attenuated, and deposited in elements on the axis. Scaling of the kernels is implicitly done during the convolution procedure to fully account for inhomogeneities present in the irradiated volume. The number of computational operations needed to compute the dose with the method is proportional to the number of calculation points. The method is tested for five accelerating potentials; 4, 6, 10, 15, and 24 MV, and applied to two geometries; one is a stack of slabs of tissue media, and the other is a mediastinum-like phantom of cork and water. In these geometries, the EGS4 Monte Carlo system has been used to generate reference dose distributions with which the dose computed with the collapsed cone convolution method is compared. Generally, the agreement between the methods is excellent. Deviations are observed in situations of lateral charged particle disequilibrium in low density media, however, but the result is superior compared to that of the generalized Batho method.},

abstract = {In this study, we present an algorithm for three-dimensional (3-D) dose reconstruction using portal images obtained with an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). For this purpose an algorithm for 2-D dose reconstruction, which was previously developed in our institution, was adapted. The external contour of the patient was used to correct for absorption of primary photons, but the presence of inhomogeneities was not taken into account. The accuracy of the algorithm was determined by irradiating two anthropomorphic breast phantoms with 6 MV photons. The dose values derived from portal images were compared with results from 3-D dose calculations, which, in turn, were verified with data obtained with an ionization chamber and film dosimetry. It was found that the application of contour information significantly improves the accuracy of 2-D dose reconstruction. If the total dose at the isocenter plane resulting from all treatment beams is reconstructed, the average deviation from the planned dose is 0.1%+/-1.7% (1 SD). If contour information is not available, the differences increase up to +/-20% for the individual beams. In that case, the dose can only be reconstructed with reasonable accuracy when (nearly) opposing beams are used. The average deviation of the 3-D reconstructed dose from the planned dose in the irradiated volume is 1.4%+/-5.4% (1 SD). If the irradiated volume is enclosed by planes less than 5 cm distant from the isocenter plane, then the average deviation is only 0.5%+/-3.4% (1 SD). It can be concluded that the proposed algorithm for a 3-D dose reconstruction allows a determination of the dose at the isocenter plane and the dose-volume histogram with an accuracy acceptable for an independent verification of the treatment.},

This paper discusses the differences in dose calculated using water with different electron densities and that calculated for different biological media and the clinical issues on dose specification including dose prescription and plan evaluation using dose to water and dose to medium. We will demonstrate that conventional photon dose calculation algorithms compute doses similar to those simulated by Monte Carlo using water with different electron densities, which are close (<4% differences) to doses to media but significantly different (up to 11%) from doses to water converted from doses to media following American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 105 recommendations.

abstract = {The effect of beam divergence on dose calculation via Monte Carlo generated dose kernels was investigated in an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (EPID). The flat-panel detector was simulated in EGSnrc with an additional 3.0 cm water buildup. The model included details of the detector's imaging cassette and the front cover upstream of it. To approximate the effect of the EPID's rear housing, a 2.1 cm air gap and 1.0 cm water slab were introduced into the simulation as equivalent backscatter material. Dose kernels were generated with an incident pencil beam of monoenergetic photons of energy 0.1, 2, 6, and 18 MeV. The orientation of the incident pencil beam was varied from 0 degrees to 14 degrees in 2 degrees increments. Dose was scored in the phosphor layer of the detector in both cylindrical (at 0 degrees) and Cartesian (at 0 degrees - 14 micro) geometries. To reduce statistical fluctuations in the Cartesian geometry simulations at large radial distances from the incident pencil beam, the voxels were first averaged bilaterally about the pencil beam and then combined into concentric square rings of voxels. Profiles of the EPID dose kernels displayed increasing asymmetry with increasing angle and energy. A comparison of the superposition (tilted kernels) and convolution (parallel kernels) dose calculation methods via the chi-comparison test (a derivative of the gamma-evaluation) in worst-case-scenario geometries demonstrated an agreement between the two methods within 0.0784 cm (one pixel width) distance-to-agreement and up to a 1.8% dose difference. More clinically typical field sizes and source-to-detector distances were also tested, yielding at most a 1.0% dose difference and the same distance-to-agreement. Therefore, the assumption of parallel dose kernels has less than a 1.8% dosimetric effect in extreme cases and less than a 1.0% dosimetric effect in most clinically relevant situations and should be suitable for most clinical dosimetric applications. The resulting time difference for the parallel kernel assumption versus the tilted kernels was 10.5 s vs 18 h (a factor of approximately 6000), dependent on existing hardware and software details.},

The method takes into account the local dose gradients of a reference distribution for critical appraisal of misalignment and collimation errors. These contribute to the maximum tolerable dose error at each evaluation point to which the local dose differences between comparison and reference data are compared. As shown, the presented concept is analogous to the gamma-concept of Low et al (1998a Med. Phys. 25 656-61) if extended to (3+1) dimensions. The pointwise dose comparisons of the reformulated concept are easier to perform and speed up the evaluation process considerably, especially for fine-grid evaluations of 3D dose distributions. The occurrences of false negative indications due to the discrete nature of the data are reduced with the method. The presented method was applied to film-measured, clinical data and compared with gamma-evaluations. 4D and 3D evaluations were performed. Comparisons prove that 4D evaluations have to be given priority, especially if complex treatment situations are verified, e.g., non-coplanar beam configurations.},

A combination of uniform intensity dMLC beams and static beams were designed to quantify the effect of MLC transmission on EPID response at the central axis of 10 x 10 cm2 beams, at off-axis positions using wide dMLC beam profiles, and at different field sizes. The EPID response to MLC transmitted radiation was 0.79 +/- 0.02 of the response to open beam radiation at the central axis of a 10 x 10 cm2 field. The EPID response to MLC transmitted radiation was further reduced relative to the open beam response with off-axis distance. The EPID response was more sensitive to field size changes for MLC transmitted radiation compared to open beam radiation by a factor of up to 1.17 at large field sizes. The results were used to create EPID response correction factors as a function of the fraction of MLC transmitted radiation, off-axis distance, and field size. Software was developed to apply the correction factors to each pixel in the TPS predicted EPID image. The corrected images agreed more closely with the measured EPID images in areas of intensity modulated fields with a large fraction of MLC transmission and, as a result the accuracy of portal dosimetry with a-Si EPIDs can be improved. Further investigation into the detector response function and the radiation source model are required to achieve improvements in accuracy for the general case.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To design and develop a real-time electronic portal imaging device (EPID)-based delivery verification system for dynamic intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) which enables detection of gross treatment delivery errors before delivery of substantial radiation to the patient.\n\nMETHODS: The system utilizes a comprehensive physics-based model to generate a series of predicted transit EPID image frames as a reference dataset and compares these to measured EPID frames acquired during treatment. The two datasets are using MLC aperture comparison and cumulative signal checking techniques. The system operation in real-time was simulated offline using previously acquired images for 19 IMRT patient deliveries with both frame-by-frame comparison and cumulative frame comparison. Simulated error case studies were used to demonstrate the system sensitivity and performance.\n\nRESULTS: The accuracy of the synchronization method was shown to agree within two control points which corresponds to approximately ∼1% of the total MU to be delivered for dynamic IMRT. The system achieved mean real-time gamma results for frame-by-frame analysis of 86.6% and 89.0% for 3%, 3 mm and 4%, 4 mm criteria, respectively, and 97.9% and 98.6% for cumulative gamma analysis. The system can detect a 10% MU error using 3%, 3 mm criteria within approximately 10 s. The EPID-based real-time delivery verification system successfully detected simulated gross errors introduced into patient plan deliveries in near real-time (within 0.1 s).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A real-time radiation delivery verification system for dynamic IMRT has been demonstrated that is designed to prevent major mistreatments in modern radiation therapy.},

@article{Star-Lack2014,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Performance optimization of indirect x-ray detectors requires proper characterization of both ionizing (gamma) and optical photon transport in a heterogeneous medium. As the tool of choice for modeling detector physics, Monte Carlo methods have failed to gain traction as a design utility, due mostly to excessive simulation times and a lack of convenient simulation packages. The most important figure-of-merit in assessing detector performance is the detective quantum efficiency (DQE), for which most of the computational burden has traditionally been associated with the determination of the noise power spectrum (NPS) from an ensemble of flood images, each conventionally having 10(7) - 10(9) detected gamma photons. In this work, the authors show that the idealized conditions inherent in a numerical simulation allow for a dramatic reduction in the number of gamma and optical photons required to accurately predict the NPS. METHODS: The authors derived an expression for the mean squared error (MSE) of a simulated NPS when computed using the International Electrotechnical Commission-recommended technique based on taking the 2D Fourier transform of flood images. It is shown that the MSE is inversely proportional to the number of flood images, and is independent of the input fluence provided that the input fluence is above a minimal value that avoids biasing the estimate. The authors then propose to further lower the input fluence so that each event creates a point-spread function rather than a flood field. The authors use this finding as the foundation for a novel algorithm in which the characteristic MTF(f), NPS(f), and DQE(f) curves are simultaneously generated from the results of a single run. The authors also investigate lowering the number of optical photons used in a scintillator simulation to further increase efficiency. Simulation results are compared with measurements performed on a Varian AS1000 portal imager, and with a previously published simulation performed using clinical fluence levels. RESULTS: On the order of only 10-100 gamma photons per flood image were required to be detected to avoid biasing the NPS estimate. This allowed for a factor of 10(7) reduction in fluence compared to clinical levels with no loss of accuracy. An optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was achieved by increasing the number of flood images from a typical value of 100 up to 500, thereby illustrating the importance of flood image quantity over the number of gammas per flood. For the point-spread ensemble technique, an additional 2× reduction in the number of incident gammas was realized. As a result, when modeling gamma transport in a thick pixelated array, the simulation time was reduced from 2.5 × 10(6) CPU min if using clinical fluence levels to 3.1 CPU min if using optimized fluence levels while also producing a higher SNR. The AS1000 DQE(f) simulation entailing both optical and radiative transport matched experimental results to within 11%, and required 14.5 min to complete on a single CPU. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrate the feasibility of accurately modeling x-ray detector DQE(f) with completion times on the order of several minutes using a single CPU. Convenience of simulation can be achieved using GEANT4 which offers both gamma and optical photon transport capabilities.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Using the graphical processing units (GPU) hardware technology, an extremely fast Monte Carlo (MC) code ARCHERRT is developed for radiation dose calculations in radiation therapy. This paper describes the detailed software development and testing for three clinical TomoTherapy{\textregistered} cases: the prostate, lung, and head & neck. METHODS: To obtain clinically relevant dose distributions, phase space files (PSFs) created from optimized radiation therapy treatment plan fluence maps were used as the input to ARCHERRT. Patient-specific phantoms were constructed from patient CT images. Batch simulations were employed to facilitate the time-consuming task of loading large PSFs, and to improve the estimation of statistical uncertainty. Furthermore, two different Woodcock tracking algorithms were implemented and their relative performance was compared. The dose curves of an Elekta accelerator PSF incident on a homogeneous water phantom were benchmarked against DOSXYZnrc. For each of the treatment cases, dose volume histograms and isodose maps were produced from ARCHERRT and the general-purpose code, GEANT4. The gamma index analysis was performed to evaluate the similarity of voxel doses obtained from these two codes. The hardware accelerators used in this study are one NVIDIA K20 GPU, one NVIDIA K40 GPU, and six NVIDIA M2090 GPUs. In addition, to make a fairer comparison of the CPU and GPU performance, a multithreaded CPU code was developed using OpenMP and tested on an Intel E5-2620 CPU. RESULTS: For the water phantom, the depth dose curve and dose profiles from ARCHERRT agree well with DOSXYZnrc. For clinical cases, results from ARCHERRT are compared with those from GEANT4 and good agreement is observed. Gamma index test is performed for voxels whose dose is greater than 10% of maximum dose. For 2%/2mm criteria, the passing rates for the prostate, lung case, and head & neck cases are 99.7%, 98.5%, and 97.2%, respectively. Due to specific architecture of GPU, modified Woodcock tracking algorithm performed inferior to the original one. ARCHERRT achieves a fast speed for PSF-based dose calculations. With a single M2090 card, the simulations cost about 60, 50, 80 s for three cases, respectively, with the 1% statistical error in the PTV. Using the latest K40 card, the simulations are 1.7-1.8 times faster. More impressively, six M2090 cards could finish the simulations in 8.9-13.4 s. For comparison, the same simulations on Intel E5-2620 (12 hyperthreading) cost about 500-800 s. CONCLUSIONS: ARCHERRT was developed successfully to perform fast and accurate MC dose calculation for radiotherapy using PSFs and patient CT phantoms.},

abstract = {Purpose: The clinical commissioning of IMRT subject to a magnetic field is challenging. The purpose of this work is to develop a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo dose calculation platform based on PENELOPE and then use the platform to validate a vendor-provided MRIdian head model toward quality assurance of clinical IMRT treatment plans subject to a 0.35 T magnetic field. Methods: PENELOPE was first translated from PENELOPE to c++ and the result was confirmed to produce equivalent results to the original code. The c++ code was then adapted to CUDA in a workflow optimized for GPU architecture. The original code was expanded to include voxelized transport with Woodcock tracking, faster electron/positron propagation in a magnetic field, and several features that make gPENELOPE highly user-friendly. Moreover, the vendor-provided MRIdian head model was incorporated into the code in an effort to apply gPENELOPE as both an accurate and rapid dose validation system. A set of experimental measurements were performed on the MRIdian system to examine the accuracy of both the head model and gPENELOPE. Ultimately, gPENELOPE was applied toward independent validation of patient doses calculated by MRIdian's KMC. Results: An acceleration factor of 152 was achieved in comparison to the original single-thread PENELOPE implementation with the original accuracy being preserved. For 16 treatment plans including stomach (4), lung (2), liver (3), adrenal gland (2), pancreas (2), spleen(1), mediastinum (1), and breast (1), the MRIdian dose calculation engine agrees with gPENELOPE with a mean gamma passing rate of 99.1%±0.6% (2%/2 mm). Conclusions: A Monte Carlo simulation platform was developed based on a GPU- accelerated version of PENELOPE. This platform was used to validate that both the vendor-provided head model and fast Monte Carlo engine used by the MRIdian system are accurate in modeling radiation transport in a patient using 2%/2 mm gamma criteria. Future applications of this platform will include dose validation and accumulation, IMRT optimization, and dosimetry system modeling for next generation MR-IGRT systems.},

abstract = {We present a GPU implementation called GMC (GPU Monte Carlo) of the low energy (<100 GeV) electromagnetic part of the Geant4 Monte Carlo code using the NVIDIA{\textregistered} CUDA programming interface. The classes for electron and photon interactions as well as a new parallel particle transport engine were implemented. The way a particle is processed is not in a history by history manner but rather by an interaction by interaction method. Every history is divided into steps that are then calculated in parallel by different kernels. The geometry package is currently limited to voxelized geometries. A modified parallel Mersenne twister was used to generate random numbers and a random number repetition method on the GPU was introduced. All phantom results showed a very good agreement between GPU and CPU simulation with gamma indices of >97.5% for a 2%/2 mm gamma criteria. The mean acceleration on one GTX 580 for all cases compared to Geant4 on one CPU core was 4860. The mean number of histories per millisecond on the GPU for all cases was 658 leading to a total simulation time for one intensity-modulated radiation therapy dose distribution of 349 s. In conclusion, Geant4-based Monte Carlo dose calculations were significantly accelerated on the GPU.},

abstract = {Purpose: Monte Carlo methods are considered the gold standard for dosimetric computations in radiotherapy. Their execution time is however still an obstacle to the routine use of Monte Carlo packages in a clinical setting. To address this problem, a completely new, and designed from the ground up for the GPU, Monte Carlo dose calculation package for voxelized geometries is proposed: GPUMCD. Method : GPUMCD implements a coupled photon-electron Monte Carlo simulation for energies in the range 0.01 MeV to 20 MeV. An analogue simulation of photon interactions is used and a Class II condensed history method has been implemented for the simulation of electrons. A new GPU random number generator, some divergence reduction methods as well as other optimization strategies are also described. GPUMCD was run on a NVIDIA GTX480 while single threaded implementations of EGSnrc and DPM were run on an Intel Core i7 860. Results : Dosimetric results obtained with GPUMCD were compared to EGSnrc. In all but one test case, 98% or more of all significant voxels passed a gamma criteria of 2%-2mm. In terms of execution speed and efficiency, GPUMCD is more than 900 times faster than EGSnrc and more than 200 times faster than DPM, a Monte Carlo package aiming fast executions. Absolute execution times of less than 0.3 s are found for the simulation of 1M electrons and 4M photons in water for monoenergetic beams of 15 MeV, including GPU-CPU memory transfers. Conclusion : GPUMCD, a new GPU-oriented Monte Carlo dose calculation platform, has been compared to EGSnrc and DPM in terms of dosimetric results and execution speed. Its accuracy and speed make it an interesting solution for full Monte Carlo dose calculation in radiation oncology.},

abstract = {Near real-time application of Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation in clinic and research is hindered by the long computational runtimes of established software. Currently, fast MC software solutions are available utilising accelerators such as graphical processing units (GPUs) or clusters based on central processing units (CPUs). Both platforms are expensive in terms of purchase costs and maintenance and, in case of the GPU, provide only limited scalability. In this work we propose a cloud-based MC solution, which offers high scalability of accurate photon dose calculations. The MC simulations run on a private virtual supercomputer that is formed in the cloud. Computational resources can be provisioned dynamically at low cost without upfront investment in expensive hardware. A client-server software solution has been developed which controls the simulations and transports data to and from the cloud efficiently and securely. The client application integrates seamlessly into a treatment planning system. It runs the MC simulation workflow automatically and securely exchanges simulation data with the server side application that controls the virtual supercomputer. Advanced encryption standards were used to add an additional security layer, which encrypts and decrypts patient data on-the-fly at the processor register level. We could show that our cloud-based MC framework enables near real-time dose computation. It delivers excellent linear scaling for high-resolution datasets with absolute runtimes of 1.1 seconds to 10.9 seconds for simulating a clinical prostate and liver case up to 1% statistical uncertainty. The computation runtimes include the transportation of data to and from the cloud as well as process scheduling and synchronisation overhead. Cloud-based MC simulations offer a fast, affordable and easily accessible alternative for near real-time accurate dose calculations to currently used GPU or cluster solutions.},

abstract = {Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) plays a key role in medical applications, especially for emission tomography and radiotherapy. However MCS is also associated with long calculation times that prevent its use in routine clinical practice. Recently, graphics processing units (GPU) became in many domains a low cost alternative for the acquisition of high computational power. The objective of this work was to develop an efficient framework for the implementation of MCS on GPU architectures. Geant4 was chosen as the MCS engine given the large variety of physics processes available for targeting different medical imaging and radiotherapy applications. In addition, Geant4 is the MCS engine behind GATE which is actually the most popular medical applications' simulation platform. We propose the definition of a global strategy and associated structures for such a GPU based simulation implementation. Different photon and electron physics effects are resolved on the fly directly on GPU without any approximations with respect to Geant4. Validations have shown equivalence in the underlying photon and electron physics processes between the Geant4 and the GPU codes with a speedup factor of 80-90. More clinically realistic simulations in emission and transmission imaging led to acceleration factors of 400-800 respectively compared to corresponding GATE simulations.},

abstract = {An essential requirement for successful radiation therapy is that the discrepancies between dose distributions calculated at the treatment planning stage and those delivered to the patient are minimized. An important component in the treatment planning process is the accurate calculation of dose distributions. The most accurate way to do this is by Monte Carlo calculation of particle transport, first in the geometry of the external or internal source followed by tracking the transport and energy deposition in the tissues of interest. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations allow one to investigate the influence of source components on beams of a particular type and their contaminant particles. Since the mid 1990s, there has been an enormous increase in Monte Carlo studies dealing specifically with the subject of the present review, i.e., external photon beam Monte Carlo calculations, aided by the advent of new codes and fast computers. The foundations for this work were laid from the late 1970s until the early 1990s. In this paper we will review the progress made in this field over the last 25 years. The review will be focused mainly on Monte Carlo modelling of linear accelerator treatment heads but sections will also be devoted to kilovoltage x-ray units and 60Co teletherapy sources.},

@article{Gustafsson2009,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Commercial EPIDs are normally used in indirect detection mode (iEPID) where incident x-ray photons are converted to optical photons in a phosphor scintillator, which are then detected by a photodiode array. The EPIDs are constructed from a number of nonwater equivalent materials which affect the dose response of the detector. The so-called direct detection EPIDs (dEPIDs), operating without the phosphor layer, have been reported to display dose response close to in-water data. In this study, the effect that different layers of materials in the EPID have on the dose response was experimentally investigated and evaluated with respect to changes in field size response and beam profiles. METHODS: An iEPID was disassembled and the different layers of materials were removed or replaced with other materials. Data were also obtained on and off the support arm and with a sheet of opaque paper blocking the optical photons from the gadolinium oxysulfide (Gd2S2O:Tb) phosphor layer. Field size response was measured for field sizes ranging from 2 x 2 to 25 x 25 cm2, and profiles for the 25 x 25 cm2 beams were extracted from the data. RESULTS: The iEPID configuration was found to be very sensitive to backscatter. The increases in output with solid water backscatter compared to the no backscatter case were 14.7% and 6.6% at the largest field size investigated for the 6 and 18 MV beams, respectively. The Gd2S2O:Tb phosphor layer had a large influence on field size response as well as beam profiles for 6 MV photons, while no major effects were observed for the 18 MV beam. For 18 MV large differences in dose response were found when the standard 1 mm Cu buildup was changed for dmax equivalent Cu or solid water buildup, indicating that head scatter largely influences dose response for this energy. When the optical photons originating in the Gd2S2O:Tb layer were blocked from reaching the photodiodes, both field size output data and beam profiles corresponded well with data obtained in the dEPID configuration as well as reference ion chamber data for both energies. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, changing the layers of material in the EPID had a dramatic effect on dose response, which was often quite complex. For 6 MV, the complex dose response is mainly caused by the optical photons from the Gd2S2O:Tb layer, while insufficient filtering of scattered radiation largely affects the dose response for the 18 MV beam. The iEPID was also found to be very sensitive to backscatter for both energies. Blocking the optical photons created in the Gd2S2O:Tb layer essentially changed the iEPID configuration into the dEPID configuration, thus demonstrating great potential for a system that can be optimized for both imaging and dosimetry.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Current amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging devices (a-Si EPIDs) that are frequently used in radiotherapy applications employ a metal plate/phosphor screen configuration to optimize x-ray detection efficiency. The phosphor acts to convert x rays into an optical signal that is detected by an underlying photodiode array. The dosimetric response of EPIDs has been well characterized, in part through the development of computational models. Such models, however, have generally made simplifying assumptions with regards to the transport of optical photons within these detectors. The goal of this work was to develop and experimentally validate a new Monte Carlo (MC) model of an a-Si EPID that simulates both x-ray and optical photon transport in a self-contained manner. Using this model the authors establish a definitive characterization of the effects of optical transport on the dosimetric response of a-Si EPIDs employing gadolinium oxysulfide phosphor screens.\n\nMETHODS: The Geant4 MC toolkit was used to develop a model of an a-Si EPID that employs standard electromagnetic and optical physics classes. The sensitivity of EPID response to uncertainties in optical transport parameters was evaluated by investigating their effects on the EPID point spread function (PSF). An optical blur kernel was also calculated to isolate the component of the PSF resulting purely from optical transport. A 6 MV photon source model was developed and integrated into the MC model to investigate EPID dosimetric response. Field size output factors and relative dose profiles were calculated for a set of open fields by separately scoring energy deposited in the phosphor and optical absorption events in the photodiode. These were then compared to quantify effects resulting from optical photon transport. The EPID model was validated against experimental measurements taken using a research EPID.\n\nRESULTS: Optical photon scatter within the phosphor screen noticeably broadened the PSF. Variations in optical transport parameters reported in the literature caused fluctuations in the PSF full width at half maximum (FWHM) and full width at tenth maximum (FWTM) of less than 3% and 5%, respectively, confirming model robustness. Greater deviations (up to 9.5% and 36% for FWHM and FWTM, respectively) were observed when optical parameters were largely different from reference values. When scoring energy deposition in the phosphor, measured and calculated output factors agreed within statistical uncertainties and at least 94% of the MC simulated profile data points passed 3%/3 mm $\gamma$-index criterion for all field sizes considered. Despite statistical uncertainties in optical simulations arising from computational limitations, no differences were observed between optical and energy deposition profiles.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Simulations demonstrated noticeable blurring of the EPID PSF when scoring optical absorption events in the photodiode relative to energy deposition in the phosphor. However, modeling the standard electromagnetic transport alone should suffice when using MC methods to predict EPID dose-response to static, open 6 MV fields with a standard a-Si photodiode array. Therefore, using energy deposition in the phosphor as a surrogate for EPID dose-response is a valid approach that should not require additional corrections for optical transport effects in current a-Si EPIDs employing phosphor screens.},

EPIDs employ a copper plate and gadolinium oxysulfide phosphor screen with an array of a-Si photodiodes to indirectly detect incident radiation. In this study, a previously developed Monte Carlo (MC) model of an a-Si EPID has been extended for transit dosimetry. The GEANT4 MC toolkit was used to integrate an a-Si EPID model with two phantoms and a 6 MV x-ray source. A solid water phantom was used to simulate EPID transmission factors, field size output factors and relative dose profiles and results were compared to experimental measurements. An anthropomorphic head phantom was used to qualitatively compare simulated and measured portal images of humanoid anatomy. Calculated transmission factors and field size output factors agreed to within 2.0% and 1.9% of experimental measurements, respectively. A comparison of calculated and measured relative dose profiles yielded >98% of points passing a gamma analysis with 3%/3 mm criterion for all field sizes. The simulated anthropomorphic head phantom image shows macroscopic anatomical features and qualitatively agrees with the measured image.

abstract = {Most textbooks on radiological physics present a broad field which includes physics of radiation therapy, diagnosis, and nuclear medicine. The emphasis is on the basic physical principles which form a common foundation for these areas. Consequently, the topics of practical interest are discussed only sparingly or completely left out. The need is felt for a book solely dedicated to radiation therapy physics with emphasis on the practical details. This book is written primarily with the needs of residents and clinical physicists in mind. Therefore, greater emphasis is given to the practice of physics in the clinic. For the residents, the book provides both basic radiation physics and physical aspects of treatment planning, using photon beam;, electron beams, and brachytherapy sources. For the clinical physicist, additionally, current information is provided on dosimetry. Except for some sections in the book dealing with the theory of absorbed dose measurements, the book should also appeal to the radiotherapy technologists. Of particular interest to them are the sections on treatment techniques, patient setups, and dosimetric calculations. Since the book is designed for a mixed audience, a careful balance had to be maintained between theory and practical details. A conscious effort was made to make the subject palatable to those noiformally trained in physics (e.g., residents and technicians) without diminishing the value of the book to the physicist. This object was hopefully achieved by a careful selection of the topics, simplification of the mathematical formalisms, and ample references to the relevant literature. In developing this text, I have been greatly helped by my physics colleagues, Drs. Jeff Williamson, Chris Deibel, Barry Werner, Ed Cytacki, Bruce Gerbi, and Subhash Sharma. I wish to thank them for reviewing the text in its various stages of development. My great appreciation goes to Sandi Kuitunen who typed the manuscript and provided the needed organization for this lengthy project. I am also thankful to Kathy Mitchell and Lynne Olson who prepared most of the illustrations for the book. Finally, I geatly value my association with Dr. Seymour Levitt, the chairman of this department, from whom I got much of the clinical philosophy I needed as a physicist. Faiz M. Khan},

abstract = {The GEANT4-based GATE Monte Carlo (MC) platform was initially focused on PET and SPECT simulations. The new release v6.0 (February 2010) proposes new tools dedicated for radiation therapy simulations. In this work, we investigated some part of this extension and proposed a general methodology for Linac simulations. Details of the modeling of a 6 MV photon beam delivered by an Elekta Precise Linac, with radiation fields ranging from 5 × 5 to 30 × 30 cm(2) at the isocenter are presented. Comparisons were performed with measurements in water. The simulations were performed in two stages: first, the patient-independent part was simulated and a phase space (PhS) was built above the secondary collimator. Then, a multiple source model (MSM) derived from the PhS was proposed to simulate the photon fluence interacting with the patient-dependent part. The selective bremsstrahlung splitting (SBS) variance reduction technique proposed in GATE was used in order to speed up the accelerator head simulation. Further investigations showed that the SBS can be safely used without biasing the simulations. Additional comparisons with full simulations performed on the EGEE grid, in a single stage from the electron source to the water phantom, allowed the evaluation of the MSM. The proposed MSM allowed for calculating depth dose and transverse profiles in 48 hours on a single 2.8 GHz CPU, with a statistical uncertainty of 0.8% for a 10 × 10 cm(2) radiation field, using voxels of 5 × 5 × 5 mm(3). Good agreement between simulations and measurements in water was observed, with dose differences of about 1% and 2% for depth doses and dose profiles, respectively. Additional gamma index comparisons were performed; more than 90% of the points for all simulations passed the 3%/3 mm gamma criterion. To our knowledge, this feasibility study is the first one illustrating the potential of GATE for external radiotherapy applications.},

abstract = {Purpose:\r\nRadiation treatments are trending toward delivering higher doses per fraction under stereotactic radiosurgery and hypofractionated treatment regimens. There is a need for accurate 3Din vivo patient dose verification using electronic portal imaging device(EPID) measurements. This work presents a model-based technique to compute full three-dimensional patient dose reconstructed from on-treatment EPID portal images (i.e., transmission images).\r\nMethods:\r\nEPIDdose is converted to incident fluence entering the patient using a series of steps which include converting measured EPIDdose to fluence at the detector plane and then back-projecting the primary source component of the EPID fluence upstream of the patient. Incident fluence is then recombined with predicted extra-focal fluence and used to calculate 3D patient dose via a collapsed-cone convolution method. This method is implemented in an iterative manner, although in practice it provides accurate results in a single iteration. The robustness of the dose reconstruction technique is demonstrated with several simple slab phantom and nine anthropomorphic phantom cases. Prostate, head and neck, and lungtreatments are all included as well as a range of delivery techniques including VMAT and dynamic intensity modulated radiation therapy(IMRT).\r\nResults:\r\nResults indicate that the patient dose reconstruction algorithm compares well with treatment planning system computed doses for controlled test situations. For simple phantom and square field tests, agreement was excellent with a 2%/2 mm 3D chi pass rate ≥98.9%. On anthropomorphic phantoms, the 2%/2 mm 3D chi pass rates ranged from 79.9% to 99.9% in the planning target volume (PTV) region and 96.5% to 100% in the low dose region (>20% of prescription, excluding PTV and skin build-up region).\r\nConclusions:\r\nAn algorithm to reconstruct delivered patient 3Ddoses from EPID exit dosimetry measurements was presented. The method was applied to phantom and patient data sets, as well as for dynamic IMRT and VMAT delivery techniques. Results indicate that the EPIDdose reconstruction algorithm presented in this work is suitable for clinical implementation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate methods of pretreatment IMRT analysis, using real measurements performed with a commercial 2D detector array, for clinical relevance and accuracy by comparing clinical DVH parameters.\n\nMETHODS: We divided the work into two parts. The first part consisted of six in-phantom tests aimed to study the sensitivity of the different analysis methods. Beam fluences, 3D dose distribution, and DVH of an unaltered original plan were compared to those of the delivered plan, in which an error had been intentionally introduced. The second part consisted of comparing gamma analysis with DVH metrics for 17 patient plans from various sites. Beam fluences were measured with the MapCHECK 2 detector, per-beam planar analysis was performed with the MapCHECK software, and 3D gamma analysis and the DVH evaluation were performed using 3DVH software.\n\nRESULTS: In a per-beam gamma analysis some of the tests yielded false positives or false negatives. However, the 3DVH software correctly described the DVH of the plan which included the error. The measured DVH from the plan with controlled error agreed with the planned DVH within 2% dose or 2% volume. We also found that a gamma criterion of 3%∕3 mm was too lax to detect some of the forced errors. Global analysis masked some problems, while local analysis magnified irrelevant errors at low doses. Small hotspots were missed for all metrics due to the spatial resolution of the detector panel. DVH analysis for patient plans revealed small differences between treatment plan calculations and 3DVH results, with the exception of very small volume structures such as the eyes and the lenses. Target coverage (D(98) and D(95)) of the measured plan was systematically lower than that predicted by the treatment planning system, while other DVH characteristics varied depending on the parameter and organ.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We found no correlation between the gamma index and the clinical impact of a discrepancy for any of the gamma index evaluation possibilities (global, local, 2D, or 3D). Some of the tests yielded false positives or false negatives in a per-beam gamma analysis. However, they were correctly accounted for in a DVH analysis. We also showed that 3DVH software is reliable for our tests, and is a viable method for correlating planar discrepancies with clinical relevance by comparing the measured DVH of target and OAR's with clinical tolerance.},

abstract = {A straightforward and accurate method was developed to verify the delivery of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to reconstruct the dose in a patient. The method is based on a computational algorithm that linearly describes the physical relationship between beamlets and dose-scoring voxels in a patient and the dose image from an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). The relationship is expressed in the form of dose response functions (responses) that are quantified using Monte Carlo (MC) particle transport techniques. From the dose information measured by the EPID the received patient dose is reconstructed by inversely solving the algorithm. The unique and novel non-iterative feature of this algorithm sets it apart from many existing dose reconstruction methods in the literature. This study presents the algorithm in detail and validates it experimentally for open and IMRT fields. Responses were first calculated for each beamlet of the selected fields by MC simulation. In-phantom and exit film dosimetry were performed on a flat phantom. Using the calculated responses and the algorithm, the exit film dose was used to inversely reconstruct the in-phantom dose, which was then compared with the measured in-phantom dose. The dose comparison in the phantom for all irradiated fields showed a pass rate of higher than 90% dose points given the criteria of dose difference of 3% and distance to agreement of 3 mm.},

abstract = {Purpose: Delivery errors during radiotherapy may lead to medical harm and reduced life expectancy for patients. Such serious incidents can be avoided by performing dose verification online, i.e., while the patient is being irradiated, creating the possibility of halting the linac in case of a large overdosage or underdosage. The offline EPID-based 3D in vivo dosimetry system clinically employed at our institute is in principle suited for online treatment verification, provided the system is able to complete 3D dose reconstruction and verification within 420 ms, the present acquisition time of a single EPID frame. It is the aim of this study to show that our EPID-based dosimetry system can be made fast enough to achieve online 3D in vivo dose verification. Methods: The current dose verification system was sped up in two ways. First, a new software package was developed to perform all computations that are not dependent on portal image acquisition separately, thus removing the need for doing these calculations in real time. Second, the 3D dose reconstruction algorithm was sped up via a new, multithreaded implementation. Dose verification was implemented by comparing planned with reconstructed 3D dose distributions delivered to two regions in a patient: the target volume and the nontarget volume receiving at least 10 cGy. In both volumes, the mean dose is compared, while in the nontarget volume, the near-maximum dose (D2) is compared as well. The real-time dosimetry system was tested by irradiating an anthropomorphic phantom with three VMAT plans: a 6 MV head-and-neck treatment plan, a 10 MV rectum treatment plan, and a 10 MV prostate treatment plan. In all plans, two types of serious delivery errors were introduced. The functionality of automatically halting the linac was also implemented and tested. Results: The precomputation time per treatment was ∼180 s/treatment arc, depending on gantry angle resolution. The complete processing of a single portal frame, including dose verification, took 266 ± 11 ms on a dual octocore Intel Xeon E5-2630 CPU running at 2.40 GHz. The introduced delivery errors were detected after 5–10 s irradiation time. Conclusions: A prototype online 3D dose verification tool using portal imaging has been developed and successfully tested for two different kinds of gross delivery errors. Thus, online 3D dose verification has been technologically achieved.},

The perturbed DVH is calculated by using a dedicated software, 3DVH (Sun Nuclear Corporation, Melbourne, FL), which is able to modify the dose distribution calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS) according to the dose discrepancies detected with planar measurements in order to predict the delivered 3D dose distribution in the patient. METHODS: Twenty-seven high-risk prostate cancer (PP) patients and 15 head and neck (HN) cancer patients, treated with IMRT technique, were analyzed. Pretreatment verifications were performed for all patients' plans by acquiring planar dose distributions of each treatment field with 2D-diode array. Measured dose distributions were compared to the calculated ones using the gamma index (GI) method applying both global (Van Dyk) and local normalization, and %GP were generated for each pair of planar doses using the following acceptance criteria: 1%∕1, 2%∕2, and 3%∕3 mm. Planar dose distributions acquired during pretreatment verifications, together with patient's DICOM RT plan, RT structure set, and RT dose files from TPS were loaded into the 3DVH software. Percentage dose differences (%DE) between DVHs, obtained by TPS and by 3DVH, were calculated; statistical correlation between %DE and %GP was studied by using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). This analysis was performed, for each patient, on planning target volumes and on some typical organs at risk of the prostatic and head and neck anatomical district. The sensitivity was calculated to correctly identify the pretreatment plans with high dose errors and to quantify the incidence of false negatives, on varying the gamma index method. RESULTS: Analysis of %DE vs %GP showed that there were only weak correlations (Pearson's r-values < 0.8). The results also showed numerous instances of false negatives (cases where high IMRT QA passing rates did not imply good agreement in anatomy dose metrics) and the reverse, mainly for the 3%∕3 mm global gamma passing rate. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of correlation between conventional IMRT QA performance metrics gamma passing rates and dose errors in DVHs values and the low sensitivity of 3%∕3 mm global gamma method show that the most common published acceptance criteria have disputable predictive power for per-patient IMRT QA.},

abstract = {Purpose: To present a clinical case in which real-time intratreatment imaging identified an multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf to be consistently deviating from its programmed and logged position by >1 mm. Methods: An EPID-based exit-fluence dosimetry system designed to prevent gross delivery errors was used to capture cine during treatment images. The author serendipitously visually identified a suspected MLC leaf displacement that was not otherwise detected. The leaf position as recorded on the EPID images was measured and log-files were analyzed for the treatment in question, the prior day's treatment, and for daily MLC test patterns acquired on those treatment days. Additional standard test patterns were used to quantify the leaf position. Results: Whereas the log-file reported no difference between planned and recorded positions, image-based measurements showed the leaf to be 1.3±0.1 mm medial from the planned position. This offset was confirmed with the test pattern irradiations. Conclusions: It has been clinically observed that log-file derived leaf positions can differ from their actual position by >1 mm, and therefore cannot be considered to be the actual leaf positions. This cautions the use of log-based methods for MLC or patient quality assurance without independent confirmation of log integrity. Frequent verification of MLC positions through independent means is a necessary precondition to trust log-file records. Intratreatment EPID imaging provides a method to capture departures from MLC planned positions.},

abstract = {In vivo dosimetry (IVD) is in use in external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to detect major errors, to assess clinically relevant differences between planned and delivered dose, to record dose received by individual patients, and to fulfill legal requirements. After discussing briefly the main characteristics of the most commonly applied IVD systems, the clinical experience of IVD during EBRT will be summarized. Advancement of the traditional aspects of in vivo dosimetry as well as the development of currently available and newly emerging noninterventional technologies are required for large-scale implementation of IVD in EBRT. These new technologies include the development of electronic portal imaging devices for 2D and 3D patient dosimetry during advanced treatment techniques, such as IMRT and VMAT, and the use of IVD in proton and ion radiotherapy by measuring the decay of radiation-induced radionuclides. In the final analysis, we will show in this Vision 20∕20 paper that in addition to regulatory compliance and reimbursement issues, the rationale for in vivo measurements is to provide an accurate and independent verification of the overall treatment procedure. It will enable the identification of potential errors in dose calculation, data transfer, dose delivery, patient setup, and changes in patient anatomy. It is the authors' opinion that all treatments with curative intent should be verified through in vivo dose measurements in combination with pretreatment checks.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to compare time-resolved (TR) and time-integrated (TI) portal dosimetry, focussing on the role of an object's position with respect to the isocenter in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Portal dose images (PDIs) are simulated and measured for different cases: a sphere (1), a bovine bone (2) and a patient geometry (3). For the simulated case (1) and the experimental case (2), several transformations are applied at different off-axis positions. In the patient case (3), three simple plans with different isocenters are created and pleural effusion is simulated in the patient. The PDIs before and after the sphere transformations, as well as the PDIs with and without simulated pleural effusion, are compared using a TI and TR gamma analysis. In addition, the performance of the TI and TR gamma analyses for the detection of real geometric changes in patients treated with clinical plans is investigated and a correlation analysis is performed between gamma fail rates and differences in dose volume histogram (DVH) metrics. The TI gamma analysis can show large differences in gamma fail rates for the same transformation at different off-axis positions (or for different plan isocenters). The TR gamma analysis, however, shows consistent gamma fail rates. For the detection of real geometric changes in patients treated with clinical plans, the TR gamma analysis has a higher sensitivity than the TI gamma analysis. However, the specificity for the TR gamma analysis is lower than for the TI gamma analysis. Both the TI and TR gamma fail rates show no correlation with changes in DVH metrics. This work shows that TR portal dosimetry is fundamentally superior to TI portal dosimetry, because it removes the strong dependence of the gamma fail rate on the off-axis position/plan isocenter. However, for 2D TR portal dosimetry, it is still difficult to interpret gamma fail rates in terms of changes in DVH metrics for patients treated with VMAT.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this work is to explore the usefulness of the gamma passing rate metric for per-patient, pretreatment dose QA and to validate a novel patient-dose∕DVH-based method and its accuracy and correlation. Specifically, correlations between: (1) gamma passing rates for three 3D dosimeter detector geometries vs clinically relevant patient DVH-based metrics; (2) Gamma passing rates of whole patient dose grids vs DVH-based metrics, (3) gamma passing rates filtered by region of interest (ROI) vs DVH-based metrics, and (4) the capability of a novel software algorithm that estimates corrected patient Dose-DVH based on conventional phantom QA data are analyzed. METHODS: Ninety six unique "imperfect" step-and-shoot IMRT plans were generated by applying four different types of errors on 24 clinical Head∕Neck patients. The 3D patient doses as well as the dose to a cylindrical QA phantom were then recalculated using an error-free beam model to serve as a simulated measurement for comparison. Resulting deviations to the planned vs simulated measured DVH-based metrics were generated, as were gamma passing rates for a variety of difference∕distance criteria covering: dose-in-phantom comparisons and dose-in-patient comparisons, with the in-patient results calculated both over the whole grid and per-ROI volume. Finally, patient dose and DVH were predicted using the conventional per-beam planar data as input into a commercial "planned dose perturbation" (PDP) algorithm, and the results of these predicted DVH-based metrics were compared to the known values. RESULTS: A range of weak to moderate correlations were found between clinically relevant patient DVH metrics (CTV-D95, parotid D(mean), spinal cord D1cc, and larynx D(mean)) and both 3D detector and 3D patient gamma passing rate (3%∕3 mm, 2%∕2 mm) for dose-in-phantom along with dose-in-patient for both whole patient volume and filtered per-ROI. There was considerable scatter in the gamma passing rate vs DVH-based metric curves. However, for the same input data, the PDP estimates were in agreement with actual patient DVH results. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma passing rate, even if calculated based on patient dose grids, has generally weak correlation to critical patient DVH errors. However, the PDP algorithm was shown to accurately predict the DVH impact using conventional planar QA results. Using patient-DVH-based metrics IMRT QA allows per-patient dose QA to be based on metrics that are both sensitive and specific. Further studies are now required to analyze new processes and action levels associated with DVH-based metrics to ensure effectiveness and practicality in the clinical setting.},

abstract = {Purpose To determine whether in-house patient-specific intensity modulated radiation therapy quality assurance (IMRT QA) results predict Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC)-Houston phantom results. Methods and Materials IROC Houston's IMRT head and neck phantoms have been irradiated by numerous institutions as part of clinical trial credentialing. We retrospectively compared these phantom results with those of in-house IMRT QA (following the institution's clinical process) for 855 irradiations performed between 2003 and 2013. The sensitivity and specificity of IMRT QA to detect unacceptable or acceptable plans were determined relative to the IROC Houston phantom results. Additional analyses evaluated specific IMRT QA dosimeters and analysis methods. Results IMRT QA universally showed poor sensitivity relative to the head and neck phantom, that is, poor ability to predict a failing IROC Houston phantom result. Depending on how the IMRT QA results were interpreted, overall sensitivity ranged from 2% to 18%. For different IMRT QA methods, sensitivity ranged from 3% to 54%. Although the observed sensitivity was particularly poor at clinical thresholds (eg 3% dose difference or 90% of pixels passing gamma), receiver operator characteristic analysis indicated that no threshold showed good sensitivity and specificity for the devices evaluated. Conclusions IMRT QA is not a reasonable replacement for a credentialing phantom. Moreover, the particularly poor agreement between IMRT QA and the IROC Houston phantoms highlights surprising inconsistency in the QA process.},

abstract = {We present an optimization method to improve the spatial resolution and the water equivalent thickness (WET) accuracy of ion radiographies. The method is designed for imaging systems measuring for each actively scanned beam spot the lateral position of the pencil beam and at the same time the Bragg curve (behind the target) in discrete steps without relying on tracker detectors to determine the ion trajectory before and after the irradiated volume. Specifically, the method was used for an imaging set-up consisting of a stack of 61 parallel-plate ionization chambers (PPIC) interleaved with absorber plates of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) working as a range telescope.The method uses not only the Bragg peak position, but approximates the entire measured Bragg curve as a superposition of differently shifted Bragg curves. Their relative weights allow to reconstruct the distribution of thickness around each scan spot of a heterogeneous phantom.The approach also allows merging the ion radiography with the geometric information of a co-registered x-ray radiography in order to increase its spatial resolution. The method was tested using Monte Carlo simulated and experimental proton radiographies of a PMMA step phantom and an anthropomorphic head phantom. For the step phantom, the effective spatial resolution was found to be 6 and 4 times higher than the nominal resolution for the simulated and experimental radiographies, respectively. For the head phantom, a gamma index was calculated to quantify the conformity of the simulated proton radiographies with a digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) obtained from an x-ray CT and properly converted into WET. For a distance-to-agreement (DTA) of 2.5 mm and a relative WET difference (RWET) of 2.5%, the passing ratio was 100%/85% for the optimized/non-optimized case, respectively. When the optimized proton radiography was merged with the co-registered DRR, the passing ratio was 100% at DTA = 1.3 mm and RWET = 1.3%. A special interpolation method allows to strongly reduce the dose by using a coarser grid of the measured beam spot position with a 5 times larger grid distance. We show that despite a dose reduction of 25 times (leading to a dose of 0.016 mGy for the current imaging set-up), the image quality of the optimized radiographies remains fairly unaffected for both the simulated and experimental case.},

abstract = {Abstract Background and purpose Target dose verification for VMAT treatments of head-and-neck (H&N) cancer using 3D in vivo EPID dosimetry is expected to be affected by daily anatomical changes. By including these anatomical changes through cone-beam CT (CBCT) information, the magnitude of this effect is investigated. Materials and methods For 20 VMAT-treated H&N cancer patients, all plan-CTs (pCTs), 633 CBCTs and 1266 EPID movies were used to compare four dose distributions per fraction: treatment planning system (TPS) calculated dose and EPID reconstructed in vivo dose, both determined using the pCT and using the CBCT. D2, D50 and D98 of the planning target volume (PTV) were determined per dose distribution. Results When including daily anatomical information, D2, D50 and D98 of the PTV change on average by 0.0 ?? 0.4% according to TPS calculations; the standard deviation of the difference between EPID and TPS target dose changes from 2.5% (pCT) to 2.1% (CBCT). Small time trends are seen for both TPS and EPID dose distributions when using the pCT, which disappear when including CBCT information. Conclusions Daily anatomical changes hardly influence the target dose distribution for H&N VMAT treatments according to TPS recalculations. Including CBCT information in EPID dose reconstructions slightly improves the agreement with TPS calculations.},

abstract = {Treatment plans are usually designed, optimized, and evaluated based on the total 3D dose distribution, motivating a total 3D dose verification. The purpose of this study was to develop a 2D transmission-dosimetry method using an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) into a simple 3D method that provides 3D dose information. In the new method, the dose is reconstructed within the patient volume in multiple planes parallel to the EPID for each gantry angle. By summing the 3D dose grids of all beams, the 3D dose distribution for the total treatment fraction is obtained. The algorithm uses patient contours from the planning CT scan but does not include tissue inhomogeneity corrections. The 3D EPID dosimetry method was tested for IMRT fractions of a prostate, a rectum, and a head-and-neck cancer patient. Planned and in vivo-measured dose distributions were within 2% at the dose prescription point. Within the 50% isodose surface of the prescribed dose, at least 97% of points were in agreement, evaluated with a 3D gamma method with criteria of 3% of the prescribed dose and 0.3 cm. Full 3D dose reconstruction on a 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm3 grid and 3D gamma evaluation took less than 15 min for one fraction on a standard PC. The method allows in vivo determination of 3D dose-volume parameters that are common in clinical practice. The authors conclude that their EPID dosimetry method is an accurate and fast tool for in vivo dose verification of IMRT plans in 3D. Their approach is independent of the treatment planning system and provides a practical safety net for radiotherapy.},

abstract = {The authors investigated the performance of several patient-specific intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) quality assurance (QA) dosimeters in terms of their ability to correctly identify dosimetrically acceptable and unacceptable IMRT patient plans, as determined by an in-house-designed multiple ion chamber phantom used as the gold standard. A further goal was to examine optimal threshold criteria that were consistent and based on the same criteria among the various dosimeters.|The authors used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine the sensitivity and specificity of (1) a 2D diode array undergoing anterior irradiation with field-by-field evaluation, (2) a 2D diode array undergoing anterior irradiation with composite evaluation, (3) a 2D diode array using planned irradiation angles with composite evaluation, (4) a helical diode array, (5) radiographic film, and (6) an ion chamber. This was done with a variety of evaluation criteria for a set of 15 dosimetrically unacceptable and 9 acceptable clinical IMRT patient plans, where acceptability was defined on the basis of multiple ion chamber measurements using independent ion chambers and a phantom. The area under the curve (AUC) on the ROC curves was used to compare dosimeter performance across all thresholds. Optimal threshold values were obtained from the ROC curves while incorporating considerations for cost and prevalence of unacceptable plans.|Using common clinical acceptance thresholds, most devices performed very poorly in terms of identifying unacceptable plans. Grouping the detector performance based on AUC showed two significantly different groups. The ion chamber, radiographic film, helical diode array, and anterior-delivered composite 2D diode array were in the better-performing group, whereas the anterior-delivered field-by-field and planned gantry angle delivery using the 2D diode array performed less well. Additionally, based on the AUCs, there was no significant difference in the performance of any device between gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm, 3%/3 mm, and 5%/3 mm. Finally, optimal cutoffs (e.g., percent of pixels passing gamma) were determined for each device and while clinical practice commonly uses a threshold of 90% of pixels passing for most cases, these results showed variability in the optimal cutoff among devices.|IMRT QA devices have differences in their ability to accurately detect dosimetrically acceptable and unacceptable plans. Field-by-field analysis with a MapCheck device and use of the MapCheck with a MapPhan phantom while delivering at planned rotational gantry angles resulted in a significantly poorer ability to accurately sort acceptable and unacceptable plans compared with the other techniques examined. Patient-specific IMRT QA techniques in general should be thoroughly evaluated for their ability to correctly differentiate acceptable and unacceptable plans. Additionally, optimal agreement thresholds should be identified and used as common clinical thresholds typically worked very poorly to identify unacceptable plans.},

abstract = {In hadrontherapy in order to fully take advantage of the assets of the ion irradiation, the position of the Bragg peak has to be monitored accurately. Here, we investigate a monitoring method relying on the detection in real time of the prompt ? emitted quasi instantaneously during the nuclear fragmentation processes. Our detection system combines a beam hodoscope and a double scattering Compton camera. The prompt-? emission points are reconstructed by intersecting the ion trajectories given by the hodoscope and the Compton cones reconstructed with the camera. We propose here to study in terms of point spread function and efficiency the theoretical feasibility of the emission points reconstruction with our set-up in the case of a photon point source in air. First we analyze the nature of all the interactions which are likely to produce an energy deposit in the three detectors of the camera. It is underlined that upper energy thresholds in both scatter detectors are required in order to select mainly Compton events (one Compton interaction in each scatter detector and one interaction in the absorber detector). Then, we study the influence of various parameters such as the photon energy and the inter-detector distances on the Compton camera response. These studies are carried out by means of Geant4 simulations. We use a source with a spectrum corresponding to the prompt-? spectrum emitted during the carbon ion irradiation of a water phantom. In the current configuration, the spatial resolution of the Compton camera is about 6 mm (Full Width at Half Maximum) and the detection efficiency 10-5. Finally, provided the detection efficiency is increased, the clinical applicability of our system is considered.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the Dosimetry Check system for patient-specific IMRT QA. Typical QA methods measure the dose in an array dosimeter surrounded by homogenous medium for which the treatment plan has been recomputed. With the Dosimetry Check system, fluence measurements acquired on a portal dosimeter is applied to the patient's CT scans. Instead of making dose comparisons in a plane, Dosimetry Check system produces isodose lines and dose-volume histograms based on the planning CT images. By exporting the dose distribution from the treatment planning system into the Dosimetry Check system, one is able to make a direct comparison between the calculated dose and the planned dose. The versatility of the software is evaluated with respect to the two IMRT techniques - step and shoot and volumetric arc therapy. The system analyzed measurements made using EPID, PTW seven29, and IBA MatriXX, and an intercomparison study was performed. Plans from patients previously treated at our institution with treated anatomical site on brain, head & neck, liver, lung, and prostate were analyzed using Dosimetry Check system for any anatomical site dependence. We have recommendations and possible precautions that may be necessary to ensure proper QA with the Dosimetry Check system.},

abstract = {In-vivo dosimetry (IVD) in external beam radiotherapy is used to detect major clinically relevant differences between planned and delivered dose. Moreover, a detailed analysis of its results, when routinely reported and discussed by the radiotherapy staff, can limit the likelihood of error transmission to many treatments. A first experience of routine EPID-based IVD in a reference point has been performed in our department for 3D-CRT treatments over a three-year period. More than 14,000 images were acquired and 1287 treatment plans were verified. The IVD checks were obtained three times in the first week and then weekly. Tolerance levels of ± 5% for pelvic-abdomen, head-neck and breast irradiations and ± 6% for lung treatments were adopted for the in-vivo measured dose per fraction. A statistical analysis of the IVD results was performed grouping the data by: anatomical regions, treatment units, open and wedged fields and gantry angles. About 10% of the checked doses per fraction showed dosimetric discrepancies out of the tolerance levels. The causes of the discrepancies were 70% delivery or planning errors, 20% morphological changes and 10% procedural limitations. 41 cases (3.2%) have required special investigations because their in-vivo doses per fraction, averaged over the first three sessions, were out of the tolerance levels and in 19 cases (1.5%) the deviations gave rise to an intervention. Statistically significant differences of average variations between planned and delivered doses were observed for: (i) 30° wedged 10 MV fields with respect to those of other wedged or open 10 MV fields delivered by two linacs, due to the incorrect TPS implementation of that wedge transmission factor; (ii) anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior beams with respect to the other gantry orientations for one linac, due to the beam attenuation introduced by the treatment couch; (iii) lateral fields with respect to medial fields of breast irradiations for all linacs, due to small systematic set-up variations. The analysis of our data shows a substantial homogeneity of the IVD results for all the considered body regions and treatment units. However, the observed discrepancies have supplied indications for taking further steps in the optimization process and in some cases to adopt an adaptive approach.},

abstract = {An efficient method for volumetric intensity modulated arc therapy (VMAT) planning was developed, where a single arc (360 degrees or less) is delivered under continuous variation of multileaf collimator (MLC) segments, dose rate, and gantry speed. Plans can be generated for any current linear accelerator that supports these degrees of freedom. MLC segments are derived from fluence maps at relatively coarsely sampled angular positions. The beam segments, dose rate, and gantry speed are then optimized using direct machine parameter optimization based on dose volume objectives and leaf motion constraints to minimize arc delivery time. The method can vary both dose rate and gantry speed or alternatively determine the optimal plan at constant dose rate and gantry speed. The method was used to retrospectively generate variable dose rate VMAT plans to ten patients (head and neck, prostate, brain, lung, and tonsil). In comparison to step-and-shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy, dosimetric plan quality was comparable or improved, estimated delivery times ranged from 70 to 160 s, and monitor units were consistently reduced in nine out of the ten cases by an average of approximately 6%. Optimization and final dose calculation took between 5 and 35 min depending on plan complexity.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: In our clinic a QA program for IMRT verification, fully based on dosimetric measurements with electronic portal imaging devices (EPID), has been running for over 3 years. The program includes a pre-treatment dosimetric check of all IMRT fields. During a complete treatment simulation at the linac, a portal dose image (PDI) is acquired with the EPID for each patient field and compared with a predicted PDI. In this paper, the results of this pre-treatment procedure are analysed, and intercepted errors are reported. An automated image analysis procedure is proposed to limit the number of fields that need human intervention in PDI comparison. Materials and methods: Most of our analyses are performed using the ?? index with 3% local dose difference and 3 mm distance to agreement as reference values. Scalar parameters are derived from the ?? values to summarize the agreement between measured and predicted 2D PDIs. Areas with all pixels having ?? values larger than one are evaluated, making decisions based on clinically relevant criteria more straightforward. Results: In 270 patients, the pre-treatment checks revealed four clinically relevant errors. Calculation of statistics for a group of 75 patients showed that the patient-averaged mean ?? value inside the field was 0.43 ?? 0.13 (1 SD) and only 6.1 ?? 6.8% of pixels had a ?? value larger than one. With the proposed automated image analysis scheme, visual inspection of images can be avoided in 2/3 of the cases. Conclusion: EPIDs may be used for high accuracy and high resolution routine verification of IMRT fields to intercept clinically relevant dosimetric errors prior to the start of treatment. For the majority of fields, PDI comparison can fully rely on an automated procedure, avoiding excessive workload. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The use of electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) is a promising method for the dosimetric verification of external beam, megavoltage radiation therapy-both pretreatment and in vivo. In this study, a previously developed EPID back-projection algorithm was modified for IMRT techniques and applied to an amorphous silicon EPID. By using this back-projection algorithm, two-dimensional dose distributions inside a phantom or patient are reconstructed from portal images. The model requires the primary dose component at the position of the EPID. A parametrized description of the lateral scatter within the imager was obtained from measurements with an ionization chamber in a miniphantom. In addition to point dose measurements on the central axis of square fields of different size, we also used dose profiles of those fields as reference input data for our model. This yielded a better description of the lateral scatter within the EPID, which resulted in a higher accuracy in the back-projected, two-dimensional dose distributions. The accuracy of our approach was tested for pretreatment verification of a five-field IMRT plan for the treatment of prostate cancer. Each field had between six and eight segments and was evaluated by comparing the back-projected, two-dimensional EPID dose distribution with a film measurement inside a homogeneous slab phantom. For this purpose, the y-evaluation method was used with a dose-difference criterion of 2% of dose maximum and a distance-to-agreement criterion of 2 mm. Excellent agreement was found between EPID and film measurements for each field, both in the central part of the beam and in the penumbra and low-dose regions. It can be concluded that our modified algorithm is able to accurately predict the dose in the midplane of a homogeneous slab phantom. For pretreatment IMRT plan verification, EPID dosimetry is a reliable and potentially fast tool to check the absolute dose in two dimensions inside a phantom for individual IMRT fields. Film measurements inside a phantom can therefore be replaced by EPID measurements.},

abstract = {Purpose: In vivo dose verification is used to prevent major deviations between the prescribed dose and the dose really delivered to the patient. This work presents a quick and simple alternative method for verification of dose delivered to the patient using photon beams. During the treatment session, a transit dose is measured with the EPID and the dose in the patient is estimated from back projection of the portal dose. Methods and Materials: The formalism for dose calculation is described. It is independent of the detector and has been validated for different beam energies using an ionization chamber (IC). Central axis doses estimated by this formalism were compared with measured dose. Subsequently, the IC was replaced by the EPID appropriately calibrated. The feasibility of the method and its applicability in clinical use has been evaluated on 3 8 patients treated with conformal therapy for various localizations. Results: Ratios between stated and measured doses are reported. They are within the accepted tolerance of classical in vivo dosimetry (SD of 3.5%). Conclusions: The proposed method for in vivo dose verification is very simple to implement and to use in clinics. Measurements can be repeated during several sessions giving the opportunity to built new strategies for the validation by statistical evaluation of the data. The trending of in vivo dose along the treatment becomes also possible. The number of checkable beams is also increased by this method. ?? 2010 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: To analyse the results of routine EPID measurements for individualised patient dosimetry. Materials and methods: Calibrated camera-based EPIDs were used to measure the central field dose, which was compared with a dose prediction at the EPID level. For transit dosimetry, dose data were calculated using patient transmission and scatter, and compared with measured values. Furthermore, measured transit dose data were back-projected to an in vivo dose value at 5 cm depth in water (D 5) and directly compared with D 5 from the treatment planning system. Dose differences per treatment session were calculated by weighting dose values with the number of monitor units per beam. Reported errors were categorised and analysed for approximately 37,500 images from 2511 patients during a period of 24 months. Results: Pre-treatment measurements showed a mean dose difference per treatment session of 0.0 ± 1.7% (1 SD). Transfer errors were detected and corrected prior to the first treatment session. An accelerator output variation of about 4% was found between two weekly QC measurements. Patient dosimetry showed mean transit and D 5 dose differences of {\`{A}}0.7 ± 5.2% (1 SD) and {\`{A}}0.3 ± 5.6% (1 SD) per treatment session, respectively. Dose differences could be related to set-up errors, organ motion, erroneous density corrections and changes in patient anatomy. Conclusions: EPIDs can be used routinely to accurately verify treatment parameter transfer and machine output.

abstract = {At our institution EPID (electronic portal imaging device) dosimetry is routinely applied to perform in vivo dose verification of all patient treatments with curative intent since January 2008. The major impediment of the method has been the amount of work required to produce and inspect the in vivo dosimetry reports (a time-consuming and labor-intensive process). In this paper we present an overview of the actions performed to implement an automated in vivo dosimetry solution clinically. We reimplemented the EPID dosimetry software and modified the acquisition software. Furthermore, we introduced new tools to periodically inspect the record-and-verify database and automatically run the EPID dosimetry software when needed. In 2012, 95% of our 3839 treatments scheduled for in vivo dosimetry were analyzed automatically (27,633 portal images of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) fields, 5551 portal image data of VMAT arcs, and 2003 portal images of non-IMRT fields). The in vivo dosimetry verification results are available a few minutes after delivery and alerts are immediately raised when deviations outside tolerance levels are detected. After the clinical introduction of this automated solution, inspection of the detected deviations is the only remaining work. These newly developed tools are a major step forward towards full integration of in vivo EPID dosimetry in radiation oncology practice.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the usefulness of electronic portal imaging device (EPID)-based 3-dimensional (3D) transit dosimetry in a radiation therapy department by analyzing a large set of dose verification results. Methods and materials: In our institution, routine in vivo dose verification of all treatments is performed by means of 3D transit dosimetry using amorphous silicon EPIDs. The total 3D dose distribution is reconstructed using a back-projection algorithm and compared with the planned dose distribution using 3D gamma evaluation. Dose reconstruction and gamma evaluation software runs automatically in our clinic, and analysis results are (almost) immediately available. If a deviation exceeds our alert criteria, manual inspection is required. If necessary, additional phantom measurements are performed to separate patient-related errors from planning or delivery errors. Three-dimensional transit dosimetry results were analyzed per treatment site between 2012 and 2014 and the origin of the deviations was assessed. Results: In total, 4689 of 15,076 plans (31%) exceeded the alert criteria between 2012 and 2014. These alerts were patient-related and attributable to limitations of our back-projection and dose calculation algorithm or to external sources. Clinically relevant deviations were detected for approximately 1 of 430 patient treatments. Most of these errors were because of anatomical changes or deviations from the routine clinical procedure and would not have been detected by pretreatment verification. Although cone beam computed tomography scans yielded information about anatomical changes, their effect on the dose delivery was assessed quantitatively by means of 3D in vivo dosimetry. Conclusions: EPID-based transit dosimetry is a fast and efficient dose verification technique. It provides more useful information and is less time-consuming than pretreatment verification measurements of intensity modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy. Large-scale implementation of 3D transit dosimetry is therefore a powerful method to guarantee safe dose delivery during radiation therapy.},

abstract = {The gamma-evaluation method is a tool by which dose distributions can be compared in a quantitative manner combining dose-difference and distance-to-agreement criteria. Since its introduction, the gamma evaluation has been used in many studies and is on the verge of becoming the preferred dose distribution comparison method, particularly for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) verification. One major disadvantage, however, is its long computation time, which especially applies to the comparison of three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions. We present a fast algorithm for a full 3D gamma evaluation at high resolution. Both the reference and evaluated dose distributions are first resampled on the same grid. For each point of the reference dose distribution, the algorithm searches for the best point of agreement according to the gamma method in the evaluated dose distribution, which can be done at a subvoxel resolution. Speed, computer memory efficiency, and high spatial resolution are achieved by searching around each reference point with increasing distance in a sphere, which has a radius of a chosen maximum search distance and is interpolated "on-the-fly" at a chosen sample step size. The smaller the sample step size and the larger the differences between the dose distributions, the longer the gamma evaluation takes. With decreasing sample step size, statistical measures of the 3D gamma distribution converge. Two clinical examples were investigated using 3% of the prescribed dose as dose-difference and 0.3 cm as distance-to-agreement criteria. For 0.2 cm grid spacing, the change in gamma indices was negligible below a sample step size of 0.02 cm. Comparing the full 3D gamma evaluation and slice-by-slice 2D gamma evaluations ("2.5D") for these clinical examples, the gamma indices improved by searching in full 3D space, with the average gamma index decreasing by at least 8%.},

abstract = {The amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (a-Si EPID) was originally designed for positional verification in radiotherapy. Several feature of the a-Si EPID, such as the high-resolution detector array and ease of operation, have made this imaging device an attractive tool for dose measurements. The main challenge with a-Si EPID dosimetry is the deviation in scatter and dose response characteristics from a water-equivalent detector that makes the conversion of EPID signal to dose not straightforward. The aim of this thesis is to develop a model to perform 2D transit dosimetry for patient-specific treatment verification with a-Si EPID. The transit model can be used for both pre-treatment and actual treatment verification to ensure safety in different stages of the radiotherapy process. The model was based on a quadratic equation that relates the reduction in radiation intensity, represented by the ratio of exit to entrance dose, to the water-equivalent path length (EPL) of the attenuator. Coefficients in the quadratic equation were derived from a set of calibration dose planes measured for a reference beam with water phantoms of known thicknesses. Two sets of coefficients were derived separately from calibration dose planes measured with EPID and ionisation chamber (IC) in water. Consequently, with two sets of coefficients, the EPL of any attenuator can be calculated using either EPID measured dose planes or treatment planning system (TPS) computed dose planes for the treatment field to be verified. The calculated EPL, which is a property of the attenuator and independent of the dosimeter, was used to link the different dosimetry systems and provide a two-way relationship for either: (Path 1) reconstruction of in-phantom or in-vivo dose from EPID measured dose planes, for comparison with TPS planned dose; or (Path 2) prediction of EPID transit dose from TPS computed dose planes, for comparison with EPID measurement during treatment. The developed model was first tested with homogeneous and heterogeneous slab phantoms using open, enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields. Results showed that the model could accurately detect deviation between delivered and planned doses. Further evaluation with an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom and 65 test fields (open, 3D conformal, EDW, IMRT) at different gantry angles showed a mean gamma pass rate (4%/4mm criterion) of 97.6% (range: 90.0% to 100%) for in-phantom exit dose comparisons (Path 1) and 97.1% (range: 92.9% to 99.8%) for EPID transit dose comparisons (Path 2). In addition, the methods in Path 1 were expanded to reconstruct dose at other levels besides the exit level. In-phantom isocentre dose comparisons resulted in a mean gamma pass rate of 98.2% (range: 91.7% to 100%). Finally, clinical feasibility of the EPID transit dosimetry model was demonstrated for three patients (11 3D conformal fields, 18 verifications) who were undergoing radiotherapy treatment at the pelvic region. Gamma analyses with 5%/5mm criterion resulted in a mean pass rate of 97.0% (range: 92.4% to 99.6%) and 98.6% (range: 96.1% to 100%) for in-vivo comparisons at the exit level and isocentre level respectively (Path 1). The mean gamma pass rate for EPID transit dose comparisons (Path 2) was 95.6% (range: 90.7% to 99.9%). In conclusion, the 2D EPID transit dosimetry model developed in this thesis has been proven to be valid and suitable for clinical implementation. The model is: (1) practical, involving only general measurements and does not require any modification to the EPID panel, (2) generic, with the methods applicable to all a-Si EPID and TPS regardless of manufacturer and (3) flexible, allowing users to verify the accuracy of treatment delivery either at multiple planes in-vivo or at the EPID level. These are important characteristics to encourage widespread implementation of EPID transit dosimetry in different clinical setting for safer radiotherapy.},

abstract = {This work applied statistical process control to establish the control limits of the % gamma pass of patient-specific intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) quality assurance (QA), and to evaluate the efficiency of the QA process by using the process capability index (Cpml). A total of 278 IMRT QA plans in nasopharyngeal carcinoma were measured with MapCHECK, while 159 VMAT QA plans were undertaken with ArcCHECK. Six megavolts with nine fields were used for the IMRT plan and 2.5 arcs were used to generate the VMAT plans. The gamma (3%/3 mm) criteria were used to evaluate the QA plans. The % gamma passes were plotted on a control chart. The first 50 data points were employed to calculate the control limits. The Cpml was calculated to evaluate the capability of the IMRT/VMAT QA process. The results showed higher systematic errors in IMRT QA than VMAT QA due to the more complicated setup used in IMRT QA. The variation of random errors was also larger in IMRT QA than VMAT QA because the VMAT plan has more continuity of dose distribution. The average % gamma pass was 93.7% ± 3.7% for IMRT and 96.7% ± 2.2% for VMAT. The Cpml value of IMRT QA was 1.60 and VMAT QA was 1.99, which implied that the VMAT QA process was more accurate than the IMRT QA process. Our lower control limit for % gamma pass of IMRT is 85.0%, while the limit for VMAT is 90%. Both the IMRT and VMAT QA processes are good quality because Cpml values are higher than 1.0.},

Methods and materials In vivo 3D dose distributions were reconstructed for 722 fractions of 200 head-and-neck (H&N) VMAT treatments and 183 fractions of 61 lung IMRT plans. The reconstructed and planned dose distributions in the PTV were compared using (a) the ??-distribution and (b) the differences in D2, D50 and D98 between the two dose distributions. Using pre-defined tolerance levels, all fractions were classified as deviating or not deviating by both methods. The mutual agreement, the sensitivity and the specificity of the two methods were compared. Results For lung IMRT, the classification of the fractions was nearly identical for ??- and DVH-analyses of the PTV (94% agreement) and the sensitivity and specificity were comparable for both methods. Less agreement (80%) was found for H&N VMAT, while ??-analysis was both less sensitive and less specific. Conclusions DVH- and ??-analyses perform nearly equal in finding dose deviations in the PTV for lung IMRT treatments; for H&N VMAT treatments, DVH-analysis is preferable.

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of replacing pretreatment verification with in vivo electronic portal imaging device (EPID) dosimetry for prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods and Materials: Dose distributions were reconstructed from EPID images, inside a phantom (pretreatment) or the patient (five fractions in vivo) for 75 IMRT prostate plans. Planned and EPID dose values were compared at the isocenter and in two dimensions using the ?? index (3%/3 mm). The number of measured in vivo fractions required to achieve similar levels of agreement with the plan as pretreatment verification was determined. The time required to perform both methods was compared. Results: Planned and EPID isocenter dose values agreed, on average, within ??1% (1 SD) of the total plan for both pretreatment and in vivo verification. For two-dimensional field-by-field verification, an alert was raised for 10 pretreatment checks with clear but clinically irrelevant discrepancies. Multiple in vivo fractions were combined by assessing ?? images consisting of median, minimum and low (intermediate) pixel values of one to five fractions. The "low" ?? values of three fractions rendered similar results as pretreatment verification. Additional time for verification was ???2.5 h per plan for pretreatment verification, and 15 min ?? 10 min/fraction using in vivo dosimetry. Conclusions: In vivo EPID dosimetry is a viable alternative to pretreatment verification for prostate IMRT. For our patients, combining information from three fractions in vivo is the best way to distinguish systematic errors from non-clinically relevant discrepancies, save hours of quality assurance time per patient plan, and enable verification of the actual patient treatment. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The problem of determining the in vivo dosimetry for patients undergoing radiation treatment has been an area of interest since the development of the field. More recent methods of measurement employ Electronic Portal Image Devices (EPID), or dosimeter arrays, for entrance or exit fluence determination. The more recent methods of in vivo dosimetry make use of detector arrays and re-construction techniques to determine dose throughout the patient volume. One method uses an array of ion chambers located upstream of the patient. This requires a special hardware device and places an additional attenuator in the beam path, which may not be desirable. An alternative to this approach is to use the existing EPID, which is part of most modern linear accelerators, to image the patient using the treatment beam. Methods exist to deconvolve the detector function of the EPID using a series of weighted exponentials [1]. Additionally, this method has been extended to the deconvolution of the patient scatter in order to determine in vivo dosimetry. The method developed here intends to use EPID images and an iterative deconvolution algorithm to recon-struct the impinging primary fluence on the patient. This primary fluence may then be employed, using treatment time volumetric imaging, to determine dose through the entire patient volume. Presented in this paper is the initial discussion of the algorithm, and a theoretical evaluation of its efficacy using montecarlo derived virtual fluence measurements. The results presented here indi-cate an agreement of 1% dose difference within 95% the field area receiving 10% of the entrance fluence for a set of sample highly modulated fields. These results warrant continued investigation in applying this algorithm to clinical patient treatments.},

abstract = {Recently, portal imaging systems have been successfully demonstrated in dosimetric treatment verification applications, where measured and predicted images are quantitatively compared. To advance this approach to dosimetric verification, a two-step model which predicts dose deposition in arbitrary portal image detectors is presented. The algorithm requires patient CT data, source-detector distance, and knowledge of the incident beam fluence. The first step predicts the fluence entering a portal imaging detector located behind the patient. Primary fluence is obtained through ray-tracing techniques, while scatter fluence prediction requires a library of Monte Carlo-generated scatter fluence kernels. These kernels allow prediction of basic radiation transport parameters characterizing the scattered photons, including fluence and mean energy. The second step of the algorithm involves a superposition of Monte Carlo-generated pencil beam kernels, describing dose deposition in a specific detector, with the predicted incident fluence. This process is performed separately for primary and scatter fluence, and yields a predicted dose image. A small but noticeable improvement in prediction is obtained by explicitly modeling the off-axis energy spectrum softening due to the flattening filter. The algorithm is tested on a slab phantom and a simple lung phantom (6 MV). Furthermore, an anthropomorphic phantom is utilized for a simulated lung treatment (6 MV), and simulated pelvis treatment (23 MV). Data were collected over a range of air gaps (10-80 cm). Detectors incorporating both low and high atomic number buildup are used to measure portal image profiles. Agreement between predicted and measured portal dose is better than 3% in areas of low dose gradient (<30%/cm) for all phantoms, air gaps, beam energies, and detector configurations tested here. It is concluded that this portal dose prediction algorithm is fast, accurate, allows separation of primary and scatter dose, and can model arbitrary detectors.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) pretreatment verification procedure has been developed based on the measurement of two-dimensional (2D) primary fluence profiles using an amorphous silicon flat-panel electronic portal imaging device (EPID). As described in our previous work, fluence profiles are extracted from EPID images by deconvolution with kernels that represent signal spread in the EPID due to radiation and optical scattering. The deconvolution kernels are derived using Monte Carlo simulations of dose deposition in the EPID and empirical fitting methods, for both 6 and 15 MV photon energies. In our new 3D verification technique, 2D fluence modulation profiles for each IMRT field in a treatment are used as input to a treatment planning system (TPS), which then generates 3D doses. Verification is accomplished by comparing this new EPID-based 3D dose distribution to the planned dose distribution calculated by the TPS. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) point dose measurements for an IMRT treatment of an anthropomorphic phantom were in good agreement with the EPID-based 3D doses; in contrast, the planned dose under-predicts the TLD measurement in a high-gradient region by approximately 16%. Similarly, large discrepancies between EPID-based and TPS doses were also evident in dose profiles of small fields incident on a water phantom. These results suggest that our 3D EPID-based method is effective in quantifying relevant uncertainties in the dose calculations of our TPS for IMRT treatments. For three clinical head and neck cancer IMRT treatment plans, our TPS was found to underestimate the mean EPID-based doses in the critical structures of the spinal cord and the parotids by approximately 4 Gy (11%-14%). According to radiobiological modeling calculations that were performed, such underestimates can potentially lead to clinically significant underpredictions of normal tissue complication rates.},

abstract = {This work outlines the development of a robust method of calculating modulation factors used for the independent verification of MUs for IMRT and VMAT treatments, to replace onerous ion chamber measurements. Two-dimensional fluence maps were calculated for dynamic MLC fields that include MLC interleaf leakage, transmission, and tongue-and-groove effects, as characterized from EPID-acquired images. Monte Carlo-generated dose kernels were then used to calculate doses for a modulated field and that field with the modulation removed at a depth specific to the calculation point in the patient using in-house written software, Mod_Calc. The ratio of these two doses was taken to calculate modulation factors. Comparison between Mod_Calc calculation and ion chamber measurement of modulation factors for 121 IMRT fields yielded excellent agreement, where the mean difference between the two was -0.3% ± 1.2%. This validated use of Mod_Calc clinically. Analysis of 5,271 dynamic fields from clinical use of Mod_Calc gave a mean difference of 0.3% ± 1.0% between Mod_Calc and Eclipse-generated factors. In addition, 99.3% and 96.5% fields pass 5% and 2% criteria, respectively, for agreement between these two predictions. The development and use of Mod_Calc at our clinic has considerably streamlined our QA process for IMRT and RapidArc fields, compared to our previous method based on ion chamber measurements. As a result, it has made it feasible to maintain our established and trusted current in-house method of MU verification, without resorting to commercial software alternatives.},

abstract = {The accuracy of a pencil beam algorithm to predict scattered photon fluence into portal imaging systems was studied. A data base of pencil beam kernels describing scattered photon fluence behind homogeneous water slabs (1-50 cm thick) at various air gap distances (0-100 cm) was generated using the EGS Monte Carlo code. Scatter kernels were partitioned according to particle history: singly-scattered, multiply-scattered, and bremsstrahlung and positron annihilation photons. Mean energy and mean angle with respect to the incident photon pencil beam were also scored. This data allows fluence, mean energy, and mean angular data for each history type to be predicted using the pencil beam algorithm. Pencil beam algorithm predictions for 6 and 24 MV incident photon beams were compared against full Monte Carlo simulations for several inhomogeneous phantoms, including approximations to a lateral neck, and a mediastinum treatment. The accuracy of predicted scattered photon fluence, mean energy, and mean angle was investigated as a function of air gap, field size, photon history, incident beam resolution, and phantom geometry. Maximum errors in mean energies were 0.65 and 0.25 MeV for the higher and lower energy spectra, respectively, and 15 degrees for mean angles. The ability of the pencil beam algorithm to predict scatter fluence decreases with decreasing air gap, with the largest error for each phantom occurring at the exit surface. The maximum predictive error was found to be 6.9% with respect to the total fluence on the central axis. By maintaining even a small air gap (approximately 10 cm), the error in predicted scatter fluence may be kept under 3% for the phantoms and beam energies studied here. It is concluded that this pencil beam algorithm is sufficiently accurate (using International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Report No. 24 guidelines for absorbed dose) over the majority of clinically relevant air gaps, for further investigation in a portal dose prediction algorithm.},

abstract = {Images produced by commercial amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging devices (a-Si EPIDs) are subject to multiple blurring processes. Implementation of these devices for fluence measurement requires that the blur be removed from the images. A standard deconvolution operation can be performed to accomplish this assuming the blur kernel is spatially invariant and accurately known. This study determines a comprehensive blur kernel for the Varian aS500 EPID. Monte Carlo techniques are used to derive a dose kernel and an optical kernel, which are then combined to yield an overall blur kernel for both 6 and 15 MV photon beams. Experimental measurement of the line spread function (LSF) is used to verify kernel shape. Kernel performance is gauged by comparing EPID image profiles with in-air dose profiles measured using a diamond detector (approximating fluence) both before and after the EPID images have been deconvolved. Quantitative comparisons are performed using the chi metric, an extension of the well-known y metric, using acceptance criteria of 0.0784 cm (1 pixel width) distance-to-agreement (deltad) and 2% of the relative central axis fluence (deltaD). Without incorporating any free parameters, acceptance was increased from 49.0% of pixels in a cross-plane profile for a 6 MV 10 x 10 cm2 open field to 92.0%. For a 10 x 10 cm2 physically wedged field, acceptance increased from 40.3% to 73.9%. The effect of the optical kernel was found to be negligible for these chi acceptance parameters, however for (deltaD= 1%, deltad = 0.0784 cm) we observed an improvement from 66.1% (without) to 78.6% (with) of chi scores <1 (from 20.6% before deconvolution). It is demonstrated that an empirical kernel having a triple exponential form or a semiempirical kernel based on a simplified model of the detector stack can match the performance of the comprehensive kernel.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the dose response of amorphous silicon (a-Si) electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) under different acquisition settings for both open jaw defined fields and segmented intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields. Four different EPIDs were used. Two Siemens and one Elekta plus a standalone Perkin Elmer research EPID. Each was operated with different acquisition systems and settings. Dose response linearity was measured for open static jaw defined fields and 'simple' segmented IMRT fields for a range of equipment and system settings. Six 'simple' segmented IMRT fields were used. The segments of each IMRT field were fixed at 10 × 10 cm2 field size with equal MU per segment, each field having a total of 20 MU. Simultaneous measurements with an ionization chamber array (ICA) and EPID were performed to separate beam and detector response characteristics. Three different pixel calibration methods were demonstrated and compared for an example 'clinical IMRT field'. The dose response with the Elekta EPID for 'simple' segmented IMRT fields versus static fields agreed to within 2.5% for monitor unit (MU) ≥ 2. The dose response for the Siemens systems was difficult to interpret due to the poor reproducibility for segmented delivery, at MU ≥ 5, which was not observed with the standalone research EPID nor ICA on the same machine. The dose response measured under different acquisition settings and different linac/EPID combinations matched closely (≤ 1%), except for the Siemens EPID. Clinical IMRT EPID dosimetry implemented with the different pixel-to-dose calibration methods indicated that calibration at 20 MU provides equivalent results to implementing a ghosting correction model. The nonlinear dose response was consistent across both clinical EPIDs and the standalone research EPID, with the exception of the poor reproducibility seen with Siemens EPID images of IMRT fields. The nonlinear dose response was relatively insensitive to acquisition settings and appears to be primarily due to gain ghosting effects. No additional ghosting correction factor is necessary when the pixel-to-dose calibration factor at small MU calibration method is used.},

abstract = {Portal dosimetry (PD) was performed for 181 fields from 14 IMRT plans of various clinical sites at gantry zero and source-to-detector distance (SDD) of 100 cm. PD was realized using aSi1000 electronic portal imaging device (EPID) and portal dose prediction (PDP) algorithm implemented in Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). Agreement of PDP predicted and EPID measured photon fluence/dose distribution were evaluated using gamma ($\gamma$) index set at 3% at 3 mm distance to point agreement (DTA). Three gamma scaling parameters, maximum $\gamma$ ($\gamma$(max)), average $\gamma$ ($\gamma$(avg)) and percentage of points with $\gamma$ ≤ 1 ($\gamma$% ≤ 1) were estimated for each field. An independent measurement was carried out using MatriXX 2D ion chamber array with detector plane at 100 cm and $\gamma$(max), $\gamma$(avg) and $\gamma$% ≤ 1 were estimated using OmniPro IMRT analyzing software. Effect of extended SDD and gantry rotation on portal dosimetry outcome was also investigated for another 45 IMRT fields. PDP predicted and EPID measured photon fluence agrees well with overall mean values of $\gamma$(max), $\gamma$(avg) and $\gamma$% ≤ 1 at 2.02, 0.24 and 99.43%, respectively. $\gamma$(max) value was lower in 15 MV compared to 6 MV IMRT plan. Independent verification using MatriXX showed comparable overall mean values of $\gamma$(avg) and $\gamma$% ≤ 1 at 0.25 and 99.80%. However, in all plans, MatriXX showed significantly lower $\gamma$(max) (p < 0.05) with an overall mean value of 1.35. In portal dosimetry, compared to gamma values at 100 cm SDD, $\gamma$(max), $\gamma$(avg) and $\gamma$% ≤ 1 values improve from a mean of 0.16, 0.03 and 0.26 at 110 cm SDD to 0.35, 0.05 and 0.29 at 140 cm SDD. PD outcome was independent of gantry rotation. In conclusion, both MatriXX 2D ion chamber array and portal dosimetry showed comparable results and can be use as an alternative to each other for relative photon fluence verification.},

abstract = {A two step algorithm to predict portal dose images in arbitrary detector systems has been developed recently. The current work provides a validation of this algorithm on a clinically available, amorphous silicon flat panel imager. The high-atomic number, indirect amorphous silicon detector incorporates a gadolinium oxysulfide phosphor scintillating screen to convert deposited radiation energy to optical photons which form the portal image. A water equivalent solid slab phantom and an anthropomorphic phantom were examined at beam energies of 6 and 18 MV and over a range of air gaps (approximately 20-50 cm). In the many examples presented here, portal dose images in the phosphor were predicted to within 5% in low-dose gradient regions, and to within 5 mm (isodose line shift) in high-dose gradient regions. Other basic dosimetric characteristics of the amorphous silicon detector were investigated, such as linearity with dose rate (+/- 0.5%), repeatability (+/- 2%), and response with variations in gantry rotation and source to detector distance. The latter investigation revealed a significant contribution to the image from optical photon spread in the phosphor layer of the detector. This phenomenon is generally known as "glare," and has been characterized and modeled here as a radially symmetric blurring kernel. This kernel is applied to the calculated dose images as a convolution, and is successfully demonstrated to account for the optical photon spread. This work demonstrates the flexibility and accuracy of the two step algorithm for a high-atomic number detector. The algorithm may be applied to improve performance of dosimetric treatment verification applications, such as direct image comparison, backprojected patient dose calculation, and scatter correction in megavoltage computed tomography. The algorithm allows for dosimetric applications of the new, flat panel portal imager technology in the indirect configuration, taking advantage of a greater than tenfold increase in detector sensitivity over a direct configuration.},

Materials and methods: Nine plans of lung cancer patients treated with a 3D conformal technique, calculated using a simple convolution algorithm (CA), as well as five IMRT treatments of head-and-neck cancer patients, calculated with a more advanced superposition algorithm (SA), were verified. Differences between planned and reconstructed dose distributions were quantified in terms of DVH parameters. Results: For the lung cancer group, differences between the reconstructed mean PTV dose and the values calculated with the TPS were 5.0 ?? 4.2% (1SD) and -1.4 ?? 1.5% for the CA and SA algorithm, respectively. No large differences in the lung and spinal cord DVH parameters were found. For the IMRT treatments, the average dose differences in the PTV were generally below 3%. The reconstructed mean parotid gland dose was 3.2 ?? 1.2% lower, while the maximum spinal cord dose was on average 3.1 ?? 1.9% higher. Conclusions: EPID dosimetry combined with 3D dose reconstruction is a useful procedure for patient-specific QA of complex treatments. DVH parameters can be used to interpret the dose distribution delivered to the patient in the same way as during standard treatment plan evaluation. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {A high dosimetric accuracy is required for radiotherapy treatments where IMRT in combination with narrow treatment margins is applied to achieve optimally conformal dose distributions. In order to routinely verify the in vivo fluence delivery (i.e., during the actual patient treatment), our method for predicting portal dose images with a patient in the beam was validated. A unique feature of this method is that it is fully based on calibration measurements with an EPID. The portal dose image (PDI) behind a patient is dependent on the transmission of primary radiation through the patient and a contribution of scattered radiation from the patient. To derive both components, the patient geometry as observed in the planning CT scan is converted into an equivalent homogeneous phantom. A limited set of EPID measurements is required to derive the input parameters of this model. The accuracy of the in vivo PDI prediction was verified using measurements behind phantoms and four prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT. Behind homogeneous slab phantoms, the local differences between measured and predicted PDIs were within 2% inside the field, while behind a lung and a pelvic phantom, the agreement was within 3% or within 3 mm in regions with steep gradients. Outside the fields, the PDIs agreed within 2% of the global dose maximum. Evaluation of the in vivo PDI measurements behind patients showed that, on average, 87% of the pixels inside the field fulfilled the 3% local dose and 3 mm distance-to-agreement criteria. For half of the failing pixels the differences occurred due to changes in patient geometry with respect to the planning CT or due to beam attenuation by the treatment couch that was not accounted for. A fully EPID-based method for predicting portal dose images using the planning CT scan has been implemented and validated for phantoms and clinical patients.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: Pretreatment verification with an electronic portal imaging device is an important part of our patient-specific quality assurance program for advanced treatment techniques. Up to now, this verification has been performed for over 400 IMRT patient plans. For every treatment field, a 2D portal dose image (PDI) is measured and compared with a predicted PDI. Often it is not straightforward to interpret dose deviations found in these 2D comparisons in terms of clinical implications for the patient. Therefore, a method to derive the 3D patient dose based on the measured PDIs was implemented. Methods and materials: For reconstruction of the 3D patient dose, the actual fluences delivered by the accelerator are derived from measured portal dose images using an iterative method. The derived fluence map for each beam direction is then used as input for the treatment planning system to generate an adapted 3D patient dose distribution. The accuracy of this method was assessed by measurements in a water phantom. Clinical evaluation of the 3D dose reconstruction was performed for 17 IMRT patients with different tumor sites. Dose differences with respect to the original treatment plan were evaluated in individual CT slices using dose difference maps and a 3D ?? analysis and by comparing dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Results: The measurements indicated that the accuracy of the 3D dose reconstruction was within 2%/2 mm. For the patients observed dose differences with respect to the original plan were generally within 2%, except at the field edges and in the sharp dose gradients around the planning target volume (PTV). Gamma analysis showed that the dose differences were within 2%/2 mm for more than 95% of the points in all cases. Differences in DVH parameters for the PTV and organs at risk were also within 2% in nearly all cases. Conclusion: A method to derive actual delivered fluence maps from measured PDIs and to use them to reconstruct the 3D patient dose was implemented. The reconstruction eases the estimation of the clinical relevance of observed dose differences in the pretreatment measurements. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Photon scatter fluence was scored in separate bins based on the particle's history: singly scattered, multiply scattered, and bremsstrahlung and positron annihilation photons. Simultaneously, the mean energy and mean angle with respect to the incident photon pencil beam were tallied. Kernels were generated for incident photon pencil beams exhibiting monoenergetic spectra of 2.0 and 10.0 MeV, and polyenergetic spectra representative of 6 and 24 MV beams. Reciprocity was used to generate scatter fractions on the central axis for various field sizes, phantom thicknesses, and air gaps. The scatter kernels were further characterized by full width at half-maximum estimates. Modulation transfer functions were calculated, providing theoretical estimates of the limit of performance of portal imaging systems due to the intrinsic scattering of photon radiation through the patient.},

abstract = {Electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) could potentially be useful for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) QA. The data density, high resolution, large active area, and efficiency of the MV EPID make it an attractive option. However, EPIDs were designed as imaging devices, not dosimeters, and as a result they do not inherently measure dose in tissue equivalent media. EPIDose (Sun Nuclear, Melbourne, FL) is a tool designed for the use of EPIDs in IMRT QA that uses raw MV EPID images (no additional build-up and independent of gantry angle, but with dark and flood field corrections applied) to estimate absolute dose planes normal to the beam axis in a homogeneous media (i.e. similar to conventional IMRT QA methods). However, because of the inherent challenges of the EPID-based dosimetry, validating and commissioning such a system must be done very carefully, by exploring the range of use cases and using well-proven "standards" for comparison. In this work, a multi-institutional study was performed to verify accurate EPID image to dose plane conversion over a variety of conditions. Converted EPID images were compared to 2D diode array absolute dose measurements for 188 fields from 28 clinical IMRT treatment plans. These plans were generated using a number of commercially available treatment planning systems (TPS) covering various treatment sites including prostate, head and neck, brain, and lung. The data included three beam energies (6, 10, and 15 MV) and both step-and-shoot and dynamic MLC fields. Out of 26,207 points of comparison over 188 fields analyzed, the average overall field pass rate was 99.7% when 3 mm/3% DTA criteria were used (range 94.0-100 per field). The pass rates for more stringent criteria were 97.8% for 2mm/2% DTA (range 82.0-100 per field), and 84.6% for 1 mm/1% DTA (range 54.7-100 per field). Individual patient-specific sites as well, as different beam energies, followed similar trends to the overall pass rates.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to perform delivery quality assurance with ArcCHECK and 3DVH system (Sun Nuclear, FL) and to evaluate the suitability of this system for volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) (RapidArc [RA]) verification. This software calculates the delivered dose distributions in patients by perturbing the calculated dose using errors detected in fluence or planar dose measurements. The device is tested to correlate the gamma passing rate (%GP) and the composite dose predicted by 3DVH software. A total of 28 patients with prostate cancer who were treated with RA were analyzed. RA treatments were delivered to a diode array phantom (ArcCHECK), which was used to create a planned dose perturbation (PDP) file. The 3DVH analysis used the dose differences derived from comparing the measured dose with the treatment planning system (TPS)-calculated doses to perturb the initial TPS-calculated dose. The 3DVH then overlays the resultant dose on the patient[U+05F3]s structures using the resultant "PDP" beams. Measured dose distributions were compared with the calculated ones using the gamma index (GI) method by applying the global (Van Dyk) normalization and acceptance criteria, i.e., 3%/3. mm. Paired differences tests were used to estimate statistical significance of the differences between the composite dose calculated using 3DVH and %GP. Also, statistical correlation by means of logistic regression analysis has been analyzed. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis for patient plans revealed small differences between treatment plan calculations and 3DVH results for organ at risk (OAR), whereas planning target volume (PTV) of the measured plan was systematically higher than that predicted by the TPS. The t-test results between the planned and the estimated DVH values showed that mean values were incomparable (p < 0.05). The quality assurance (QA) gamma analysis 3%/3. mm showed that in all cases there were only weak-to-moderate correlations (Pearson r: 0.12 to 0.74). Moreover, clinically relevant differences increased with increasing QA passing rate, indicating that some of the largest dose differences occurred in the cases of high QA passing rates, which may be called "false negatives." The clinical importance of any disagreement between the measured and the calculated dose is often difficult to interpret; however, beam errors (either in delivery or in TPS calculation) can affect the effectiveness of the patient dose. Further research is needed to determinate the role of a PDP-type algorithm to accurately estimate patient dose effect. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists.},

abstract = {A commercial amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (EPID) has been studied to investigate its potential in the field of pretreatment verifications of step and shoot, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 6 MV photon beams. The EPID was calibrated to measure absolute exit dose in a water-equivalent phantom at patient level, following an experimental approach, which does not require sophisticated calculation algorithms. The procedure presented was specifically intended to replace the time-consuming in-phantom film dosimetry. The dosimetric response was characterized on the central axis in terms of stability, linearity, and pulse repetition frequency dependence. The a-Si EPID demonstrated a good linearity with dose (within 2% from 1 monitor unit), which represent a prerequisite for the application in IMRT. A series of measurements, in which phantom thickness, air gap between the phantom and the EPID, field size and position of measurement of dose in the phantom (entrance or exit) varied, was performed to find the optimal calibration conditions, for which the field size dependence is minimized. In these conditions (20 cm phantom thickness, 56 cm air gap, exit dose measured at the isocenter), the introduction of a filter for the low-energy scattered radiation allowed us to define a universal calibration factor, independent of field size. The off-axis extension of the dose calibration was performed by applying a radial correction for the beam profile, distorted due to the standard flood field calibration of the device. For the acquisition of IMRT fields, it was necessary to employ home-made software and a specific procedure. This method was applied for the measurement of the dose distributions for 15 clinical IMRT fields. The agreement between the dose distributions, quantified by the gamma index, was found, on average, in 97.6% and 98.3% of the analyzed points for EPID versus TPS and for EPID versus FILM, respectively, thus suggesting a great potential of this EPID for IMRT dosimetric applications.},

abstract = {A new method for rapid evaluation of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans has been developed, using portal images for reconstruction of the dose delivered to a virtual three-dimensional (3D) phantom. This technique can replace an array of less complete but more time-consuming measurements. A reference dose calculation is first created by transferring an IMRT plan to a cylindrical phantom, retaining the treatment gantry angles. The isocenter of the fields is placed on or near the phantom axis. This geometry preserves the relative locations of high and low dose regions and has the required symmetry for the dose reconstruction. An electronic portal image (EPI) is acquired for each field, representing the dose in the midplane of a virtual phantom. The image is convolved with a kernel to correct for the lack of scatter, replicating the effect of the cylindrical phantom surrounding the dose plane. This avoids the need to calculate fluence. Images are calibrated to a reference field that delivers a known dose to the isocenter of this phantom. The 3D dose matrix is reconstructed by attenuation and divergence corrections and summed to create a dose matrix (PI-dose) on the same grid spacing as the reference calculation. Comparison of the two distributions is performed with a gradient-weighted 3D dose difference based on dose and position tolerances. Because of its inherent simplicity, the technique is optimally suited for detecting clinically significant variances from a planned dose distribution, rather than for use in the validation of IMRT algorithms. An analysis of differences between PI-dose and calculation, delta PI, compared to differences between conventional quality assurance (QA) and calculation, delta CQ, was performed retrospectively for 20 clinical IMRT cases. PI-dose differences at the isocenter were in good agreement with ionization chamber differences (mean delta PI = -0.8%, standard deviation sigma = 1.5%, against delta CQ = 0.3%, sigma = 1.0%, respectively). PI-dose plane differences had significantly less variance than film plane differences (sigma = 1.1 and 2.1%, respectively). Twenty-two further cases were evaluated using 3D EPI-dosimetry alone. The mean difference delta over volumes with doses above 80% of the isocenter value was delta = -0.3%, sigma(delta) = 0.7%, and standard deviations of the distributions ranged from 1.0 to 2.0%. Verification time per plan, from initial calculation, delivery, dose reconstruction to evaluation, takes less than 1.5 h and is more than four times faster than conventional QA.},

Methods and Materials Eleven patients were enrolled on the protocol; 9 completed and were analyzed. Pretreatment intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) patient-specific quality assurance was performed using a stringent local 3%, 3-mm ?? criterion to verify that the planned fluence had been appropriately transferred to and delivered by the linear accelerator. Transit dosimetric EPID images were then acquired during treatment and compared offline with predicted transit images using a global 5%, 3-mm ?? criterion. Results There were 288 transit images analyzed. The overall ?? pass rate was 89.1% ?? 9.8% (average ?? 1 SD). For the subset of images for which the linear accelerator couch did not interfere with the measurement, the ?? pass rate was 95.7% ?? 2.4%. A case study is presented in which the transit dosimetry algorithm was able to identify that a lung patient's bilateral pleural effusion had resolved in the time between the planning CT scan and the treatment. Conclusions The EPID transit dosimetry algorithm under consideration, previously described and verified in a phantom study, is feasible for use in treatment delivery verification for real patients. Two-dimensional EPID transit dosimetry can play an important role in indicating when a treatment delivery is inconsistent with the original plan. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate comparatively the percentage gamma passing rate (%GP) of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) pre-treatment volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) dosimetric verification and their correlation and sensitivity with percentage dosimetric errors (%DE). METHODS: %GP of 2D and 3D pre-treatment VMAT quality assurance (QA) with different acceptance criteria was obtained by ArcCHECK{\textregistered} (Sun Nuclear Corporation, Melbourne, FL) for 20 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and 20 patients with oesophageal cancer. %DE were calculated from planned dose-volume histogram (DVH) and patients' predicted DVH calculated by 3DVH{\textregistered} software (Sun Nuclear Corporation). Correlation and sensitivity between %GP and %DE were investigated using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). RESULTS: Relatively higher %DE on some DVH-based metrics were observed for both patients with NPC and oesophageal cancer. Except for 2%/2 mm criterion, the average %GPs for all patients undergoing VMAT were acceptable with average rates of 97.11% ± 1.54% and 97.39% ± 1.37% for 2D and 3D 3%/3 mm criteria, respectively. The number of correlations for 3D was higher than that for 2D (21 vs 8). However, the general correlation was still poor for all the analysed metrics (9 out of 26 for 3D 3%/3 mm criterion). The average area under the curve (AUC) of ROCs was 0.66 ± 0.12 and 0.71 ± 0.21 for 2D and 3D evaluations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of correlation between %GP and %DE for both 2D and 3D pre-treatment VMAT dosimetric evaluation. DVH-based dose metrics evaluation obtained from 3DVH will provide more useful analysis.

As new and more complicated treatment techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), are implemented into clinical practice, verifying the accuracy of treatment delivery becomes increasingly important. Existing methods for treatment verification are highly labor intensive. We have developed a method for verifying the delivery of external beam radiotherapy and implemented the methodology into a system consisting of both hardware and software components. The system uses grayscale images acquired on the treatment machine from the planned treatment beams. From these images, the photon fluence distribution of each beam is derived. These measured photon fluence maps are then used as input to a separate dose calculation engine to compute the delivered absolute dose and the dose distribution in the same patient, assuming that the patient is set up as required by the treatment plan. The dose distribution generated from the measured fluence maps can then be compared to that of the treatment plan. Software tools, such as overlaying isodose curves generated with this method on those imported from the plan, dose difference maps, dose difference volume histograms, and three-dimensional perspective views of the dose differences, have also been developed. The system thus provides a means to verify the dose, the dose prescription, and the monitor units applied. The potential exists with a suitable electronic portal imaging system to reduce the quality assurance efforts, especially for IMRT.},

For test cases prostate, head-and-neck, C-shape and multitarget prescription dose are 75.6 Gy, 50.4 Gy, 50 Gy and 50 Gy, respectively. VMAT dose distributions were comparable to dMLC IMRT plans. Our planning results matched TG 119 planning results. For treatment plans studied, conformity indices ranged from 1.05-1.23 (IMRT) and 1.04-1.23 (VMAT). Homogeneity indices ranged from 4.6{%}-11.0{%} (IMRT) and 4.6{%}-10.5{%} (VMAT). The ratio of total monitor units necessary for dMLC IMRT to that of VMAT was in the range of 1.1-2.0.

The diode based field size dependency was found to be within 0.5% of the reference. The dose rate-based dependency was well within 1% of the TPS reference, and the angular dependency was found to be ± 3% of the reference, as tested for BEV angles, for both beams. Dosimetry of fixed arcs, using both narrow and wide field widths, resulted in clinically acceptable global gamma passing rates on the 3%/3mm level and 10% threshold. Dosimetry of narrow arcs showed an improvement over published literature. The clinical VMAT cases demonstrated high level of dosimetry accuracy in gamma passing rates.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify the ability of electronic portal imaging device (EPID) dosimetry used during treatment (in vivo) in detecting variations that can occur in the course of patient treatment. METHODS: Images of transmitted radiation from in vivo EPID measurements were converted to a 2D planar dose at isocenter and compared to the treatment planning dose using a prototype software system. Using the treatment planning system (TPS), four different types of variability were modeled: overall dose scaling, shifting the positions of the multileaf collimator (MLC) leaves, shifting of the patient position, and changes in the patient body contour. The gamma pass rate was calculated for the modified and unmodified plans and used to construct a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the detectability of the different parameter variations. The detectability is given by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The TPS was also used to calculate the impact of the variations on the target dose-volume histogram. RESULTS: Nine intensity modulation radiation therapy plans were measured for four different anatomical sites consisting of 70 separate fields. Results show that in vivo EPID dosimetry was most sensitive to variations in the machine output, AUC = 0.70 - 0.94, changes in patient body habitus, AUC = 0.67 - 0.88, and systematic shifts in the MLC bank positions, AUC = 0.59 - 0.82. These deviations are expected to have a relatively small clinical impact [planning target volume (PTV) D99 change <7%]. Larger variations have even higher detectability. Displacements in the patient's position and random variations in MLC leaf positions were not readily detectable, AUC < 0.64. The D99 of the PTV changed by up to 57% for the patient position shifts considered here. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo EPID dosimetry is able to detect relatively small variations in overall dose, systematic shifts of the MLC's, and changes in the patient habitus. Shifts in the patient's position which can introduce large changes in the target dose coverage were not readily detected.},

abstract = {This study compares the EPID dosimetry algorithms of two commercial systems for pretreatment QA, and analyzes dosimetric measurements made with each system alongside the results obtained with a standard diode array. 126 IMRT fields are examined with both EPID dosimetry systems (EPIDose by Sun Nuclear Corporation, Melbourne FL, and Portal Dosimetry by Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto CA) and the diode array, MapCHECK (also by Sun Nuclear Corporation). Twenty-six VMAT arcs of varying modulation complexity are examined with the EPIDose and MapCHECK systems. Optimization and commissioning testing of the EPIDose physics model is detailed. Each EPID IMRT QA system is tested for sensitivity to critical TPS beam model errors. Absolute dose gamma evaluation (3%, 3 mm, 10% threshold, global normalization to the maximum measured dose) yields similar results (within 1%-2%) for all three dosimetry modalities, except in the case of off-axis breast tangents. For these off-axis fields, the Portal Dosimetry system does not adequately model EPID response, though a previously-published correction algorithm improves performance. Both MapCHECK and EPIDose are found to yield good results for VMAT QA, though limitations are discussed. Both the Portal Dosimetry and EPIDose algorithms, though distinctly different, yield similar results for the majority of clinical IMRT cases, in close agreement with a standard diode array. Portal dose image prediction may overlook errors in beam modeling beyond the calculation of the actual fluence, while MapCHECK and EPIDose include verification of the dose calculation algorithm, albeit in simplified phantom conditions (and with limited data density in the case of the MapCHECK detector). Unlike the commercial Portal Dosimetry package, the EPIDose algorithm (when sufficiently optimized) allows accurate analysis of EPID response for off-axis, asymmetric fields, and for orthogonal VMAT QA. Other forms of QA are necessary to supplement the limitations of the Portal Vision Dosimetry system.},

abstract = {Amorphous silicon (a-Si) electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) continue to be investigated as treatment verification tools, with a particular focus on intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). This verification could be accomplished through a comparison of measured portal images to predicted portal dose images. A general fluence determination tailored to portal dose image prediction would be a great asset in order to model the complex modulation of IMRT. A proposed physics-based parameter fluence model was commissioned by matching predicted EPID images to corresponding measured EPID images of multileaf collimator (MLC) defined fields. The two-source fluence model was composed of a focal Gaussian and an extrafocal Gaussian-like source. Specific aspects of the MLC and secondary collimators were also modeled (e.g., jaw and MLC transmission factors, MLC rounded leaf tips, tongue and groove effect, interleaf leakage, and leaf offsets). Several unique aspects of the model were developed based on the results of detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the linear accelerator including (1) use of a non-Gaussian extrafocal fluence source function, (2) separate energy spectra used for focal and extrafocal fluence, and (3) different off-axis energy spectra softening used for focal and extrafocal fluences. The predicted energy fluence was then convolved with Monte Carlo generated, EPID-specific dose kernels to convert incident fluence to dose delivered to the EPID. Measured EPID data were obtained with an a-Si EPID for various MLC-defined fields (from 1 x 1 to 20 x 20 cm2) over a range of source-to-detector distances. These measured profiles were used to determine the fluence model parameters in a process analogous to the commissioning of a treatment planning system. The resulting model was tested on 20 clinical IMRT plans, including ten prostate and ten oropharyngeal cases. The model predicted the open-field profiles within 2%, 2 mm, while a mean of 96.6% of pixels over all IMRT fields was in agreement with the 2%, 3 mm criteria. This model demonstrates accuracy commensurate to existing methods for IMRT pretreatment verification with portal dose image prediction of complex clinical examples (< 2%, 3 mm).},

abstract = {The spatial resolution from Compton cameras suffers from measurement uncertainties in interaction positions and energies. The degree of degradation in spatial resolution is shift-variant (SV) over the field-of-view (FOV) because the imaging principle is based on the conical surface integration. In our study, the shift-variant point spread function (SV-PSF) is derived from point source measurements at various positions in the FOV and is incorporated into the system matrix of a fully three-dimensional, accelerated reconstruction, i.e. the listmode ordered subset expectation maximization (LMOSEM) algorithm, for resolution recovery. Simulation data from point sources were used to estimate SV and asymmetric parameters for Gaussian, Cauchy, and general parametric PSFs. Although little difference in the fitness accuracy between Gaussian and general parametric PSFs was observed, the general parametric model showed greater flexibility over the FOV in shaping the curve between that for Gaussian and Cauchy functions. The estimated asymmetric SV-PSFs were incorporated into the LMOSEM for resolution recovery. For simulation data from a single point source at the origin, all LMOSEM-SV-PSFs improved the spatial resolution by 2.6 times over the standard LMOSEM. For two point-source simulations, reconstructions also gave a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution and resulted in a greater recovered activity ratio at different positions in the FOV.},

abstract = {Proton and ion beam therapies become increasingly relevant in radiation therapy. To fully exploit the potential of this irradiation technique and to achieve maximum target volume conformality, the verification of particle ranges is highly desirable. Many research activities focus on the measurement of the spatial distributions of prompt gamma rays emitted during irradiation. A passively collimating knife-edge slit camera is a promising option to perform such measurements. In former publications, the feasibility of accurate detection of proton range shifts in homogeneous targets could be shown with such a camera. We present slit camera measurements of prompt gamma depth profiles in inhomogeneous targets. From real treatment plans and their underlying CTs, representative beam paths are selected and assembled as one-dimensional inhomogeneous targets built from tissue equivalent materials. These phantoms have been irradiated with monoenergetic proton pencil beams. The accuracy of range deviation estimation as well as the detectability of range shifts is investigated in different scenarios. In most cases, range deviations can be detected within less than 2 mm. In close vicinity to low-density regions, range detection is challenging. In particular, a minimum beam penetration depth of 7 mm beyond a cavity is required for reliable detection of a cavity filling with the present setup. Dedicated data post-processing methods may be capable of overcoming this limitation.},

abstract = {Proton therapy treatments are based on a proton RBE (relative biological effectiveness) relative to high-energy photons of 1.1. The use of this generic, spatially invariant RBE within tumors and normal tissues disregards the evidence that proton RBE varies with linear energy transfer (LET), physiological and biological factors, and clinical endpoint. Based on the available experimental data from published literature, this review analyzes relationships of RBE with dose, biological endpoint and physical properties of proton beams. The review distinguishes between endpoints relevant for tumor control probability and those potentially relevant for normal tissue complication. Numerous endpoints and experiments on sub-cellular damage and repair effects are discussed. Despite the large amount of data, considerable uncertainties in proton RBE values remain. As an average RBE for cell survival in the center of a typical spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP), the data support a value of $\sim$1.15 at 2 Gy/fraction. The proton RBE increases with increasing LETd and thus with depth in an SOBP from $\sim$1.1 in the entrance region, to $\sim$1.15 in the center, $\sim$1.35 at the distal edge and $\sim$1.7 in the distal fall-off (when averaged over all cell lines, which may not be clinically representative). For small modulation widths the values could be increased. Furthermore, there is a trend of an increase in RBE as ($\alpha$/$\beta$)x decreases. In most cases the RBE also increases with decreasing dose, specifically for systems with low ($\alpha$/$\beta$)x. Data on RBE for endpoints other than clonogenic cell survival are too diverse to allow general statements other than that the RBE is, on average, in line with a value of $\sim$1.1. This review can serve as a source for defining input parameters for applying or refining biophysical models and to identify endpoints where additional radiobiological data are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties to clinically acceptable levels.},

Although the device has been assembled from components of positron emission tomographs developed for nuclear medicine applications, substantial modifications had to be made for meeting the requirements of ion therapy monitoring. These changes regard the geometrical detector configuration as well as the data acquisition and processing. Since 1997 this technique has been applied to monitor the fractionated irradiation of more than 180 patients predominantly suffering from tumours in the head and neck region. It could be demonstrated that this new PET technique is capable of assessing parameters being relevant for quality assurance of carbon ion therapy, i.e. the particle range in tissue, the position of the irradiated volume with respect to anatomical landmarks and local deviations between the planned and the applied dose distributions. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Compton Cameras emerged as an alternative for real-time dose monitoring techniques for Particle Therapy (PT), based on the detection of prompt-gammas. As a consequence of the Compton scattering process, the gamma origin point can be restricted onto the surface of a cone (Compton cone). Through image reconstruction techniques, the distribution of the gamma emitters can be estimated, using cone-surfaces backprojections of the Compton cones through the image space, along with more sophisticated statistical methods to improve the image quality. To calculate the Compton cone required for image reconstruction, either two interactions, the last being photoelectric absorption, or three scatter interactions are needed. Because of the high energy of the photons in PT the first option might not be adequate, as the photon is not absorbed in general. However, the second option is less efficient. That is the reason to resort to spectral reconstructions, where the incoming $\gamma$ energy is considered as a variable in the reconstruction inverse problem. Jointly with prompt gamma, secondary neutrons and scattered photons, not strongly correlated with the dose map, can also reach the imaging detector and produce false events. These events deteriorate the image quality. Also, high intensity beams can produce particle accumulation in the camera, which lead to an increase of random coincidences, meaning events which gather measurements from different incoming particles. The noise scenario is expected to be different if double or triple events are used, and consequently, the reconstructed images can be affected differently by spurious data. The aim of the present work is to study the effect of false events in the reconstructed image, evaluating their impact in the determination of the beam particle ranges. A simulation study that includes misidentified events (neutrons and random coincidences) in the final image of a Compton Telescope for PT monitoring is presented. The complete chain of detection, from the beam particle entering a phantom to the event classification, is simulated using FLUKA. The range determination is later estimated from the reconstructed image obtained from a two and three-event algorithm based on Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization. The neutron background and random coincidences due to a therapeutic-like time structure are analyzed for mono-energetic proton beams. The time structure of the beam is included in the simulations, which will affect the rate of particles entering the detector.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a proliferation in the development of targeted radionuclide cancer therapy. It is now possible to use baseline clinical and imaging assessments to determine the most effective therapy and to tailor this therapy during the course of treatment based on radiation dosimetry and tumor response. Although this personalized approach to medicine has the advantage of maximizing therapeutic effect while limiting toxicity, it can be challenging to implement and expensive. Further, in order to use targeted radionuclide therapy effectively, there is a need for multidisciplinary awareness, education, and collaboration across the scientific, industrial, and medical communities. Even more important, there is a growing understanding that combining radiopharmaceuticals with conventional treatment such as chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy may limit patient morbidity while improving survival. Developments in radiopharmaceuticals as biomarkers capable of predicting therapeutic response and targeting disease are playing a central role in medical research. Adoption of a practical approach to manufacturing and delivering radiopharmaceuticals, assessing patient eligibility, optimizing post-therapy follow-up, and addressing reimbursement issues will be essential for their success.},

abstract = {Abstract Purpose: The aim of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and deformable image registration (DIR)–based “dose of the day” calculations for adaptive proton therapy. Methods: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy plans were designed for 3 head and neck patients that required replanning, and hence had a replan computed tomography (CT). Proton plans were generated for different beam arrangements and optimizations: intensity modulated proton therapy and single-field uniform dose. We used an in-house DIR software implemented at our institution to generate a deformed CT, by warping the planning CT onto the daily CBCT. This CBCT had a similar patient geometry to the replanned CT. Dose distributions on the replanned CT were considered the gold standard for “dose of the day” calculations, and were compared with doses on deformed CT (our method) and directly on the calibrated CBCT and rigidly aligned planning CT (alternative methods) in t...},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the ability of a prototype Compton camera (CC) to measure prompt gamma rays (PG) emitted during delivery of clinical proton pencil beams for prompt gamma imaging (PGI) as a means of providing in vivo verification of the delivered proton radiotherapy beams. A water phantom was irradiated with clinical 114 MeV and 150 MeV proton pencil beams. Up to 500 cGy of dose was delivered per irradiation using clinical beam currents. The prototype CC was placed 15 cm from the beam central axis and PGs from 0.2 MeV up to 6.5 MeV were measured during irradiation. From the measured data (2D) images of the PG emission were reconstructed. (1D) profiles were extracted from the PG images and compared to measured depth dose curves of the delivered proton pencil beams. The CC was able to measure PG emission during delivery of both 114 MeV and 150 MeV proton beams at clinical beam currents. 2D images of the PG emission were reconstructed for single 150 MeV proton pencil beams as well as for a 5 × 5 cm mono-energetic layer of 114 MeV pencil beams. Shifts in the Bragg peak (BP) range were detectable on the 2D images. 1D profiles extracted from the PG images show that the distal falloff of the PG emission profile lined up well with the distal BP falloff. Shifts as small as 3 mm in the beam range could be detected from the 1D PG profiles with an accuracy of 1.5 mm or better. However, with the current CC prototype, a dose of 400 cGy was required to acquire adequate PG signal for 2D PG image reconstruction. It was possible to measure PG interactions with our prototype CC during delivery of proton pencil beams at clinical dose rates. Images of the PG emission could be reconstructed and shifts in the BP range were detectable. Therefore PGI with a CC for in vivo range verification during proton treatment delivery is feasible. However, improvements in the prototype CC detection efficiency and reconstruction algorithms are necessary to make it a clinically viable PGI system.},

abstract = {In order to exploit the advantages of ion-beam therapy in a clinical setting, delivery verification techniques are necessary to detect deviations from the planned treatment. Efforts are currently oriented towards the development of devices for real-time range monitoring. Among the different detector concepts proposed, Compton cameras are employed to detect prompt gammas and represent a valid candidate for real-time range verification. We present the first on-beam test of MACACO, a Compton telescope (multi-layer Compton camera) based on lanthanum bromide crystals and silicon photo-multipliers. The Compton telescope was first characterized through measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. The detector linearity was measured employing 22 Na and Am-Be sources, obtaining about 10% deviation from linearity at 3.44 MeV. A spectral image reconstruction algorithm was tested on synthetic data. Point-like sources emitting gamma rays with energy between 2 and 7 MeV were reconstructed with 3–5 mm resolution. The two-layer Compton telescope was employed to measure radiation emitted from a beam of 150 MeV protons impinging on a cylindrical PMMA target. Bragg-peak shifts were achieved via adjustment of the PMMA target location and the resulting measurements used during image reconstruction. Reconstructed Bragg peak profiles proved sufficient to observe peak-location differences within 10 mm demonstrating the potential of the MACACO Compton Telescope as a monitoring device for ion-beam therapy.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the possibility of introducing site-specific range margins to replace current generic margins in proton therapy. Further, the goal was to study the potential of reducing margins with current analytical dose calculations methods. For this purpose we investigate the impact of complex patient geometries on the capability of analytical dose calculation algorithms to accurately predict the range of proton fields. Dose distributions predicted by an analytical pencil-beam algorithm were compared with those obtained using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations (TOPAS). A total of 508 passively scattered treatment fields were analyzed for seven disease sites (liver, prostate, breast, medulloblastoma-spine, medulloblastoma-whole brain, lung and head and neck). Voxel-by-voxel comparisons were performed on two-dimensional distal dose surfaces calculated by pencil-beam and MC algorithms to obtain the average range differences and root mean square deviation for each field for the distal position of the 90% dose level (R90) and the 50% dose level (R50). The average dose degradation of the distal falloff region, defined as the distance between the distal position of the 80% and 20% dose levels (R80-R20), was also analyzed. All ranges were calculated in water-equivalent distances. Considering total range uncertainties and uncertainties from dose calculation alone, we were able to deduce site-specific estimations. For liver, prostate and whole brain fields our results demonstrate that a reduction of currently used uncertainty margins is feasible even without introducing MC dose calculations. We recommend range margins of 2.8% + 1.2 mm for liver and prostate treatments and 3.1% + 1.2 mm for whole brain treatments, respectively. On the other hand, current margins seem to be insufficient for some breast, lung and head and neck patients, at least if used generically. If no case specific adjustments are applied, a generic margin of 6.3% + 1.2 mm would be needed for breast, lung and head and neck treatments. We conclude that the currently used generic range uncertainty margins in proton therapy should be redefined site specific and that complex geometries may require a field specific adjustment. Routine verifications of treatment plans using MC simulations are recommended for patients with heterogeneous geometries.},

The response of the Compton camera to a photon point source with a realistic energy spectrum (corresponding to the prompt $\gamma$-ray spectrum emitted during the carbon irradiation of a water phantom) is studied by means of Geant4 simulations. Our Compton camera consists of a stack of 2 mm thick silicon strip detectors as a scatter detector and of a scintillator plate as an absorber detector. Four scintillators are considered: LYSO, NaI, LaBr3 and BGO. LYSO and BGO appear as the most suitable materials, due to their high photo-electric cross-sections, which leads to a high percentage of fully absorbed photons. Depth-of-interaction measurements are shown to have limited influence on the spatial resolution of the camera. In our case, the thickness which gives the best compromise between a high percentage of photons that are fully absorbed and a low parallax error is about 4 cm for the LYSO detector and 4.5 cm for the BGO detector. The influence of the width of the absorber detector on the spatial resolution is not very pronounced as long as it is lower than 30 cm.},

abstract = {Electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) have been the preferred tools for verification of patient positioning for radiotherapy in recent decades. Since EPID images contain dose information, many groups have investigated their use for radiotherapy dose measurement. With the introduction of the amorphous-silicon EPIDs, the interest in EPID dosimetry has been accelerated because of the favourable characteristics such as fast image acquisition, high resolution, digital format, and potential for in vivo measurements and 3D dose verification. As a result, the number of publications dealing with EPID dosimetry has increased considerably over the past ???15 years. The purpose of this paper was to review the information provided in these publications. Information available in the literature included dosimetric characteristics and calibration procedures of various types of EPIDs, strategies to use EPIDs for dose verification, clinical approaches to EPID dosimetry, ranging from point dose to full 3D dose distribution verification, and current clinical experience. Quality control of a linear accelerator, pre-treatment dose verification and in vivo dosimetry using EPIDs are now routinely used in a growing number of clinics. The use of EPIDs for dosimetry purposes has matured and is now a reliable and accurate dose verification method that can be used in a large number of situations. Methods to integrate 3D in vivo dosimetry and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) procedures, such as the use of kV or MV cone-beam CT, are under development. It has been shown that EPID dosimetry can play an integral role in the total chain of verification procedures that are implemented in a radiotherapy department. It provides a safety net for simple to advanced treatments, as well as a full account of the dose delivered. Despite these favourable characteristics and the vast range of publications on the subject, there is still a lack of commercially available solutions for EPID dosimetry. As strategies evolve and commercial products become available, EPID dosimetry has the potential to become an accurate and efficient means of large-scale patient-specific IMRT dose verification for any radiotherapy department. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Application of functional imaging to radiotherapy (RT) is a rapidly expanding field with the development of new modalities and techniques. Functional imaging of PET in conjunction with RT provides new avenues towards the clinical application of dose painting - a new RT strategy delivering optimized dose redistribution according to the functional imaging information to further improve tumour control. Two prototypical strategies of dose painting are reviewed: dose painting by contours (DPBC) and dose painting by numbers (DPBN). DPBN set a linear correlation of the boost dose and image intensity of this same voxel while homogeneous dose is given to the subvolume contoured by a threshold created in PET images in DPBC.

abstract = {PURPOSE: In an aging society, many senior citizens want less invasive treatment because of potential medical complications. The National Institute of Radiological Sciences has started to treat stage I lung cancer with single-fraction carbon-ion radiation therapy (CIRT) as a dose escalation prospective phase 1/2 trial. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of CIRT for patients 80 years of age and older, undergoing single-fraction CIRT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Peripheral non-small cell lung cancer patients who were treated with single-fraction CIRT were prospectively followed. We analyzed the data from among these patients 80 years of age and older.
RESULTS: There were 70 patients. Median age was 83 years (range: 80-89) and median follow-up period was 42.7 months (range: 12-128 months). Three-year local control, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 88.0%, 81.6%, and 72.4%, respectively. Five-year local control, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 85.8%, 64.9%, and 39.7%, respectively. There were no adverse effects higher than grade 2 either in the acute or late phase in terms of skin and lung. Analgesic agents were necessary for only 5 patients (7.1%), to relieve muscular or rib fracture pain caused by irradiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Single-fraction CIRT was low-risk and effective, even for the elderly.},

abstract = {Radiotherapy is currently used in around 50% of cancer treatments and relies on the \r\ndeposition of energy directly into tumour tissue. Although it is generally effective, \r\nsome of the deposited energy can adversely affect healthy tissue outside the tumour \r\nvolume, especially in the case of photon radiation (gamma and X-rays). Improved \r\nradiotherapy outcomes can be achieved by employing ion beams due to the charac-\r\nteristic energy deposition curve which culminates in a localised, high radiation dose \r\n(in form of a Bragg peak). In addition to ion radiotherapy, novel sensitisers, such as \r\nnanoparticles, have shown to locally increase the damaging effect of both photon and \r\nion radiation, when both are applied to the tumour area. Amongst the available nano\r\n-\r\nparticle systems, gold nanoparticles have become particularly popular due to several \r\nadvantages: biocompatibility, well-established methods for synthesis in a wide range \r\nof sizes, and the possibility of coating of their surface with a large number of different \r\nmolecules to provide partial control of, for example, surface charge or interaction with \r\nserum proteins. This gives a full range of options for design parameter combinations, in \r\nwhich the optimal choice is not always clear, partially due to a lack of understanding of \r\nmany processes that take place upon irradiation of such complicated systems. In this \r\nreview, we summarise the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy with photons and \r\nions in the presence and absence of nanoparticles, as well as the influence of some of \r\nthe core and coating design parameters of nanoparticles on their radiosensitisation \r\ncapabilities.},

abstract = {We aim to define a site-specific robustness protocol to be used during the clinical plan evaluation process. Plan robustness of 16 skull base IMPT plans to systematic range and random set-up errors have been retrospectively and systematically analysed. This was determined by calculating the error-bar dose distribution (ebDD) for all the plans and by defining some metrics used to define protocols aiding the plan assessment. Additionally, an example of how to clinically use the defined robustness database is given whereby a plan with sub-optimal brainstem robustness was identified. The advantage of using different beam arrangements to improve the plan robustness was analysed. Using the ebDD it was found range errors had a smaller effect on dose distribution than the corresponding set-up error in a single fraction, and that organs at risk were most robust to the range errors, whereas the target was more robust to set-up errors. A database was created to aid planners in terms of plan robustness aims in these volumes. This resulted in the definition of site-specific robustness protocols. The use of robustness constraints allowed for the identification of a specific patient that may have benefited from a treatment of greater individuality. A new beam arrangement showed to be preferential when balancing conformality and robustness for this case. The ebDD and error-bar volume histogram proved effective in analysing plan robustness. The process of retrospective analysis could be used to establish site-specific robustness planning protocols in proton therapy. These protocols allow the planner to determine plans that, although delivering a dosimetrically adequate dose distribution, have resulted in sub-optimal robustness to these uncertainties. For these cases the use of different beam start conditions may improve the plan robustness to set-up and range uncertainties.},

abstract = {We discovered an empirical relationship between the logarithm of mean excitation energy (ln Im) and the effective atomic number (EAN) of human tissues, which allows for computing patient-specific proton stopping power ratios (SPRs) using dual-energy CT (DECT) imaging. The accuracy of the DECT method was evaluated for 'standard' human tissues as well as their variance. The DECT method was compared to the existing standard clinical practice-a procedure introduced by Schneider et al at the Paul Scherrer Institute (the stoichiometric calibration method). In this simulation study, SPRs were derived from calculated CT numbers of known material compositions, rather than from measurement. For standard human tissues, both methods achieved good accuracy with the root-mean-square (RMS) error well below 1%. For human tissues with small perturbations from standard human tissue compositions, the DECT method was shown to be less sensitive than the stoichiometric calibration method. The RMS error remained below 1% for most cases using the DECT method, which implies that the DECT method might be more suitable for measuring patient-specific tissue compositions to improve the accuracy of treatment planning for charged particle therapy. In this study, the effects of CT imaging artifacts due to the beam hardening effect, scatter, noise, patient movement, etc were not analyzed. The true potential of the DECT method achieved in theoretical conditions may not be fully achievable in clinical settings. Further research and development may be needed to take advantage of the DECT method to characterize individual human tissues.},

abstract = {In scanned carbon-ion (C-ion) radiotherapy, some primary C-ions undergo nuclear reactions before reaching the target and the resulting particles deliver doses to regions at a significant distance from the central axis of the beam. The effects of these particles on physical dose distribution are accounted for in treatment planning by representing the transverse profile of the scanned C-ion beam as the superposition of three Gaussian distributions. In the calculation of biological dose distribution, however, the radiation quality of the scanned C-ion beam has been assumed to be uniform over its cross-section, taking the average value over the plane at a given depth (monochrome model). Since these particles, which have relatively low radiation quality, spread widely compared to the primary C-ions, the radiation quality of the beam should vary with radial distance from the central beam axis. To represent its transverse distribution, we propose a trichrome beam model in which primary C-ions, heavy fragments with atomic number Z ≥ 3, and light fragments with Z ≤ 2 are assigned to the first, second, and third Gaussian components, respectively. Assuming a realistic beam-delivery system, we performed computer simulations using Geant4 Monte Carlo code for analytical beam modeling of the monochrome and trichrome models. The analytical beam models were integrated into a treatment planning system for scanned C-ion radiotherapy. A target volume of 20  ×  20  ×  40 mm(3) was defined within a water phantom. A uniform biological dose of 2.65 Gy (RBE) was planned for the target with the two beam models based on the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM). The plans were recalculated with Geant4, and the recalculated biological dose distributions were compared with the planned distributions. The mean target dose of the recalculated distribution with the monochrome model was 2.72 Gy (RBE), while the dose with the trichrome model was 2.64 Gy (RBE). The monochrome model underestimated the RBE within the target due to the assumption of no radial variations in radiation quality. Conversely, the trichrome model accurately predicted the RBE even in a small target.Our results verify the applicability of the trichrome model for clinical use in C-ion radiotherapy treatment planning.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the potential reduction of small bowel volume receiving high-dose radiation by using kilovoltage X-ray cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and quantized margin selection for adaptive bladder cancer treatment. Methods and Materials: Twenty bladder patients were planned conformally using a four-field, 15-mm uniform margin technique. Two additional planning target volumes (PTVs) were created using margins quantized to 5 and 10 mm in the superior direction only. CBCTs (???8 scans/patient) were acquired during treatment. CBCT volumes were registered with CT planning scans to determine setup errors and to select the appropriate PTV of the day. Margin reduction in other directions was considered. Outlining of small bowel in every fraction is required to properly quantify the volume of small bowel spared from high doses. In the case of CBCT this is not always possible owing to artifacts created by small bowel movement and the presence of gas. A simpler method was adopted by considering the volume difference between PTVs created using uniform and adapted margins, which corresponds to the potential volume of small bowel sparing. Results: The average small bowel volume that can be spared by this form of adaptive radiotherapy is 31 ?? 23 cm3 (??1 SD). The bladder for 1 patient was systematically smaller than the planning scan and hence demonstrated the largest average reduction of 76 cm3. The clinical target volume to PTV margins in other directions can be safely reduced to 10 mm except in the anterior direction where, like the superior direction, the bladder showed significant variation. Conclusions: Online CBCT-assisted plan selection based on quantized margins can significantly reduce the volume of small bowel receiving high doses for some bladder patients. CBCT allows the 15-mm margins used in some directions to be safely reduced to 10 mm. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In proton therapy, the prompt-$\gamma$ (PG) radiation produced by the interactions between protons and matter is related to the range of the beam in the patient. Tomographic Compton imaging is currently studied to establish a PG image and verify the treatment. However the quality of the reconstructed images depends on a number of factors such as the volume attenuation, the spatial and energy resolutions of the detectors, incomplete absorptions of high energy photons and noise from other particles reaching the camera. The impact of all these factors was not assessed in details. In this paper we investigate the influence of the PG energy spectrum on the reconstructed images. To this aim, we describe the process from the Monte Carlo simulation of the proton irradiation, through the Compton imaging of the PG distribution, up to the image reconstruction with a statistical MLEM method. We identify specific PG energy windows that are more relevant to detect discrepancies with the treatment plan. We find that for the simulated Compton device, the incomplete absorption of the photons with energy above about 2 MeV prevents the observation of the PG distributions at specific energies. It also leads to blurred images and smooths the distal slope of the 1D PG profiles obtained as projections on the central beam axis. We show that a selection of the events produced by $\gamma$ photons having deposited almost all their energy in the camera allows to largely improve the images, a result that emphasizes the importance of the choice of the detector. However, this initial-energy-based selection is not accessible in practice. We then propose a method to estimate the range of the PG profile both for specific deposited-energy windows and for the full spectrum emission. The method relies on two parameters. We use a learning approach for their estimation and we show that it allows to detect few millimeter shifts of the PG profiles.},

abstract = {The precision in proton radiotherapy treatment planning depends on the accuracy of the information used to calculate the stopping power properties of the tissues in the patient's body. This information is obtained from computed tomography (CT) images using a calibration curve to convert CT Hounsfield units into relative proton stopping power values. The validity of a stoichiometric method to create the calibration curve has been verified by measuring pairs of Hounsfield units and stopping power values for animal tissue samples. It was found that the agreement between measurement and calibration curve is better than 1% if beam hardening effects in the acquisition of the CT images can be neglected. The influence of beam hardening effects on the quantitative reading of the CT measurements is discussed and an estimation for the overall range precision of proton beams is given. It is expected that the range of protons in the human body can be controlled to better than +/-1.1% of the water equivalent range in soft tissue and +/-1.8% in bone, which translates into a range precision of about 1-3 mm in typical treatment situations.},

abstract = {Protons have long been recognized as low LET radiation in radiotherapy. However, a detailed account of LET (linear energy transfer) and RBE (relative biological effectiveness) changes with incident beam energy and depth in tissue is still unresolved. This issue is particularly important for treatment planning, where the physical dose prescription is calculated from a RBE using cobalt as the reference radiation. Any significant RBE changes with energy or depth will be important to incorporate in treatment planning. In this paper we present microdosimetry spectra for the proton beam at various energies and depths and compare the results to cell survival studies performed at Loma Linda. An empirically determined biological weighting function that depends on lineal energy is used to correlate the microdosimetry spectra with cell survival data. We conclude that the variations in measured RBE with beam energy and depth are small until the distal edge of the beam is reached. On the distal edge, protons achieve stopping powers as high as 100 keV/micron, which is reflected in the lineal energy spectra taken there. Lineal energy spectra 5 cm beyond the distal edge of the Bragg peak also show a high LET component but at a dose rate 600 times smaller than observed inside the proton field.},

abstract = {This study aims at selecting and evaluating a ripple filter design compatible with non-isocentric proton and carbon ion scanning beam treatment delivery for a compact nozzle. The use of non-isocentric treatments when the patient is shifted as close as possible towards the nozzle exit allows for a reduction in the air gap and thus an improvement in the quality of scanning proton beam treatment delivery. Reducing the air gap is less important for scanning carbon ions, but ripple filters are still necessary for scanning carbon ion beams to reduce the number of energy steps required to deliver homogeneous SOBP. The proper selection of ripple filters also allows a reduction in the possible transverse and depth-dose inhomogeneities that could appear in non-isocentric conditions in particular. A thorough review of existing ripple filter designs over the past 16 years is performed and a design for non-isocentric treatment delivery is presented. A unique ripple filter quality index (QIRiFi) independent of the particle type and energy and representative of the ratio between energy modulation and induced scattering is proposed. The Bragg peak width evaluated at the 80% dose level (BPW80) is proposed to relate the energy modulation of the delivered Bragg peaks and the energy layer step size allowing the production of homogeneous SOBP. Gate/Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations have been validated for carbon ion and ripple filter simulations based on measurements performed at CNAO and subsequently used for a detailed analysis of the proposed ripple filter design. A combination of two ripple filters in a series has been validated for non-isocentric delivery and did not show significant transverse and depth-dose inhomogeneities. Non-isocentric conditions allow a significant reduction in the spot size at the patient entrance (up to 350% and 200% for protons and carbon ions with range shifter, respectively), and therefore in the lateral penumbra in the patients.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: In carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT), the use of different relative biological effectiveness (RBE) models in the RBE-weighted dose (DRBE) calculation can lead to deviations in the physical dose (Dphy) delivered to the patient. Our aim is to reduce target Dphy deviations by converting prescription dose values. Material and methods: Planning data of patients treated at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) were collected, with prescribed doses per fraction ranging from 3.6Gy (RBE) to 4.6Gy (RBE), according to the Japanese semi-empirical model. The Dphy was Monte Carlo (MC) re-calculated simulating the NIRS beamline. The local effect model (LEM)_I was then applied to estimate DRBE. Target median DRBE ratios between MC+LEM_I and NIRS plans determined correction factors for the conversion of prescription doses. Plans were re-optimized in a LEM_I-based commercial system, prescribing the NIRS uncorrected and corrected DRBE. Results: The MC+LEM_I target median DRBE was respectively 15% and 5% higher than the NIRS reference, for the lowest and highest dose levels. Uncorrected DRBE prescription resulted in significantly lower target Dphy in re-optimized plans, with respect to NIRS plans. Conclusions: Prescription dose conversion factors could minimize target physical dose variations due to the use of different radiobiological models in the calculation of CIRT RBE-weighted dose.},

@article{Fuchs2015,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Helium ions ((4)He) may supplement current particle beam therapy strategies as they possess advantages in physical dose distribution over protons. To assess potential clinical advantages, a dose calculation module accounting for relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was developed and integrated into the treatment planning system Hyperion.\n\nMETHODS: Current knowledge on RBE of (4)He together with linear energy transfer considerations motivated an empirical depth-dependent "zonal" RBE model. In the plateau region, a RBE of 1.0 was assumed, followed by an increasing RBE up to 2.8 at the Bragg-peak region, which was then kept constant over the fragmentation tail. To account for a variable proton RBE, the same model concept was also applied to protons with a maximum RBE of 1.6. Both RBE models were added to a previously developed pencil beam algorithm for physical dose calculation and included into the treatment planning system Hyperion. The implementation was validated against Monte Carlo simulations within a water phantom using $\gamma$-index evaluation. The potential benefits of (4)He based treatment plans were explored in a preliminary treatment planning comparison (against protons) for four treatment sites, i.e., a prostate, a base-of-skull, a pediatric, and a head-and-neck tumor case. Separate treatment plans taking into account physical dose calculation only or using biological modeling were created for protons and (4)He.\n\nRESULTS: Comparison of Monte Carlo and Hyperion calculated doses resulted in a $\gamma$mean of 0.3, with 3.4% of the values above 1 and $\gamma$1% of 1.5 and better. Treatment plan evaluation showed comparable planning target volume coverage for both particles, with slightly increased coverage for (4)He. Organ at risk (OAR) doses were generally reduced using (4)He, some by more than to 30%. Improvements of (4)He over protons were more pronounced for treatment plans taking biological effects into account. All OAR doses were within tolerances specified in the QUANTEC report.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The biological (4)He model proposed above is a first approach matching biological data published so far. The advantage of (4)He seems to lie in the reduction of dose to surrounding tissue and to OARs. Nevertheless, additional biological experiments and treatment planning studies with larger patient numbers and more tumor indications are necessary to study the possible benefits of helium ion beam therapy in detail.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyze factors affecting proton stopping-power-ratio (SPR) estimations and range uncertainties in proton therapy planning using the standard stoichiometric calibration. The SPR uncertainties were grouped into five categories according to their origins and then estimated based on previously published reports or measurements. For the first time, the impact of tissue composition variations on SPR estimation was assessed and the uncertainty estimates of each category were determined for low-density (lung), soft, and high-density (bone) tissues. A composite, 95th percentile water-equivalent-thickness uncertainty was calculated from multiple beam directions in 15 patients with various types of cancer undergoing proton therapy. The SPR uncertainties (1$\sigma$) were quite different (ranging from 1.6% to 5.0%) in different tissue groups, although the final combined uncertainty (95th percentile) for different treatment sites was fairly consistent at 3.0–3.4%, primarily because soft tissue is the dominant tissue type in the human body. The dominant contributing factor for uncertainties in soft tissues was the degeneracy of Hounsfield numbers in the presence of tissue composition variations. To reduce the overall uncertainties in SPR estimation, the use of dual-energy computed tomography is suggested. The values recommended in this study based on typical treatment sites and a small group of patients roughly agree with the commonly referenced value (3.5%) used for margin design. By using tissue-specific range uncertainties, one could estimate the beam-specific 4 Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed. 0031-9155/12/134095+21$33.00 {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine Printed in the UK & the USA 4095 4096 M Yang et al range margin by accounting for different types and amounts of tissues along a beam, which may allow for customization of range uncertainty for each beam direction.

abstract = {Proton computed tomography (CT) has been described as a solution for imaging the proton stopping power of patient tissues, therefore reducing the uncertainty of the conversion of x-ray CT images to relative stopping power (RSP) maps and its associated margins. This study aimed to investigate this assertion under the assumption of ideal detection systems. We have developed a Monte Carlo framework to assess proton CT performances for the main steps of a proton therapy treatment planning, i.e. proton or x-ray CT imaging, conversion to RSP maps based on the calibration of a tissue phantom, and proton dose simulations. Irradiations of a computational phantom with pencil beams were simulated on various anatomical sites and the proton range was assessed on the reference, the proton CT-based and the x-ray CT-based material maps. Errors on the tissue's RSP reconstructed from proton CT were found to be significantly smaller and less dependent on the tissue distribution. The imaging dose was also found to be much more uniform and conformal to the primary beam. The mean absolute deviation for range calculations based on x-ray CT varies from 0.18 to 2.01 mm depending on the localization, while it is smaller than 0.1 mm for proton CT. Under the assumption of a perfect detection system, proton range predictions based on proton CT are therefore both more accurate and more uniform than those based on x-ray CT.},

abstract = {The use of charged particle therapy to control tumours non-invasively offers advantages over conventional radiotherapy. Protons and heavy ions deposit energy far more selectively than X-rays, allowing a higher local control of the tumour, a lower probability of damage to healthy tissue, low risk of complications and the chance for a rapid recovery after therapy. Charged particles are also useful for treating tumours located in areas that surround tissues that are radiosensitive and in anatomical sites where surgical access is limited. Current trial outcomes indicate that accelerated ions can potentially replace surgery for radical cancer treatments, which might be beneficial as the success of surgical cancer treatments are largely dependent on the expertise and experience of the surgeon and the location of the tumour. However, to date, only a small number of controlled randomized clinical trials have made comparisons between particle therapy and X-rays. Therefore, although the potential advantages are clear and supported by data, the cost:benefit ratio remains controversial. Research in medical physics and radiobiology is focusing on reducing the costs and increasing the benefits of this treatment.},

abstract = {In carbon ion beams, biological effects vary along the ion track; hence, to quantify them, specific radiobiological models are needed. One of them, the local effect model (LEM), in particular version I (LEM I), is implemented in treatment planning systems (TPS) clinically used in European particle therapy centers. From the physical properties of the specific ion radiation, the LEM calculates the survival probabilities of the cell or tissue type under study, provided that some determinant input parameters are initially defined. Mathematical models can be used to predict, for instance, the tumor control probability (TCP), and then evaluate treatment outcomes. This work studies the influence of the LEM I input parameters on the TCP predictions in the specific case of prostate cancer. Several published input parameters and their combinations were tested. Their influence on the dose distributions calculated for a water phantom and for a patient geometry was evaluated using the TPS TRiP98. Changing input parameters induced clinically significant modifications of the mean dose (up to a factor of 3.5), spatial dose distribution, and TCP predictions (up to factor of 2.6 for D50). TCP predictions were found to be more sensitive to the parameter threshold dose (Dt) than to the biological parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Additionally, an analytical expression was derived for correlating $\alpha$, $\beta$ and Dt, and this has emphasized the importance of [Formula: see text]. The improvement of radiobiological models for particle TPS will only be achieved when more patient outcome data with well-defined patient groups, fractionation schemes and well-defined end-points are available.},

abstract = {In carbon ion radiotherapy there is an urgent clinical need to develop objective tools for the conversion of relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted doses based on different models. In this work we introduce a clinically oriented method to compare NIRS-based and LEM-based GyE systems, minimizing differences in physical dose distributions between treatment plans. Carbon ion plans were optimized on target volumes of cubic and spherical shapes, for RBE-weighted dose prescription levels ranging from 3.6 to 4.4 GyE. Plans were calculated for target sizes from 4 to 12 cm defining three beam geometries: single beam, opposed beam and orthogonal beam configurations. The two treatment planning systems currently employed in clinical practice were used, providing the NIRS-based and LEM-based GyE calculations. Physical dose distributions of NIRS-based and LEM-based treatment plans were compared. LEM-based prescription doses that minimize differences in physical dose distributions between the two systems were found. These doses were compared with the mean RBE-weighted dose obtained with a Monte Carlo code (FLUKA) interfaced with LEM I. In the investigated dose range, LEM-based RBE-weighted prescription doses, that minimize differences with NIRS plans, should be higher than NIRS reported prescription doses. The optimal dose depends on target size, shape and position, number of beams and dose level. The opposed beam configuration resulted in the smallest average prescription dose difference (0.45 ± 0.09 GyE). The second approach of recalculating NIRS RBE-weighted dose with a Monte Carlo code interfaced with LEM resulted in no significant difference with the results obtained from the planning study. The delivery of a voxel by voxel iso-effective plan, if different RBE models are employed, is not feasible; it is however possible to minimize differences in a treatment plan with the simple approach presented here. Dose prescription ultimately represents a clinical task under the responsibility of the radiation oncologist, the presented analysis intends to be a quantitative and objective way to assist the clinical decision.},

abstract = {Purpose: Clinical proton beam therapy has been based on the use of a generic relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.0 or 1.1, since the available evidence has been interpreted as indicating that the magnitude of RBE variation with treatment parameters is small relative to our abilities to determine RBEs. As substantial clinical experience and additional experimental determinations of RBE have accumulated and the number of proton radiation therapy centers is projected to increase, it is appropriate to reassess the rationale for the continued use of a generic RBE and for that RBE to be 1.0–1.1. Methods and Materials: Results of experimental determinations of RBE of in vitro and in vivo systems are examined, and then several of the considerations critical to a decision to move from a generic to tissue-, dose/fraction-, and LET-specific RBE values are assessed. The impact of an error in the value assigned to RBE on normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) is discussed. The incidence of major morbidity in proton-treated patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for malignant tumors of the skull base and of the prostate is reviewed. This is followed by an analysis of the magnitude of the experimental effort to exclude an error in RBE of ≥10% using in vivo systems. Results: The published RBE values, using colony formation as the measure of cell survival, from in vitro studies indicate a substantial spread between the diverse cell lines. The average value at mid SOBP (Spread Out Bragg Peak) over all dose levels is ≈1.2, ranging from 0.9 to 2.1. The average RBE value at mid SOBP in vivo is ≈1.1, ranging from 0.7 to 1.6. Overall, both in vitro and in vivo data indicate a statistically significant increase in RBE for lower doses per fraction, which is much smaller for in vivo systems. There is agreement that there is a measurable increase in RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP, which results in an extension of the bioeffective range of the beam in the range of 1–2 mm. There is no published report to indicate that the RBE of 1.1 is low. However, a substantial proportion of patients treated at ≈2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE)/fraction 5 or more years ago were treated by a combination of both proton and photon beams. Were the RBE to be erroneously underestimated by ≈10%, the increase in complication frequency would be quite serious were the complication incidence for the reference treatment ≥3% and the slope of the dose response curves steep, e.g., a $\gamma$50 ≈ 4. To exclude ≥1.2 as the correct RBE for a specific condition or tissue at the 95% confidence limit would require relatively large and multiple assays. Conclusions: At present, there is too much uncertainty in the RBE value for any human tissue to propose RBE values specific for tissue, dose/fraction, proton energy, etc. The experimental in vivo and clinical data indicate that continued employment of a generic RBE value and for that value to be 1.1 is reasonable. However, there is a local “hot region” over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP and an extension of the biologically effective range. This needs to be considered in treatment planning, particularly for single field plans or for an end of range in or close to a critical structure. There is a clear need for prospective assessments of normal tissue reactions in proton irradiated patients and determinations of RBE values for several late responding tissues in laboratory animal systems, especially as a function of dose/fraction in the range of 1–4 Gy.},

abstract = {Radiobiological studies have shown for some time that the effects of ionising radiation on cells are mainly explained by modification of the DNA. Numerous studies over the past 50 years have accumulated clear evidence of the cause-effect relationship between damage to DNA and the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of ionising radiation. However, the path from irradiation of the cells to the induction of biological effects comprises several complex steps. The first step involves interactions between the radiation and the cellular environment. These consist of physical and chemical reactions which produce ions, excited molecules and radical species. Excitations and ionisations are complete in about 10(-15) s, and are followed by a chemical thermal equilibrium of the species produced within 10(-12) s. These species then diffuse from their site of production and provoke alterations to a variety of cellular components. This damage is detected by cellular surveillance systems, which in turn activate signalling cascades, gene transcription and enzyme recruitment, which participate in the cellular response. In most cases, cell cycle arrest occurs, allowing, according to the biological relevance of the DNA damage, either a process of DNA repair or programmed cell death (apoptosis). The accuracy of the DNA repair which is performed depends on the complexity of the DNA lesion and on the DNA repair machinery fidelity itself. Improper DNA repair can lead to mutation, chromosome aberration, genetic instability, oncogenic transformation and, ultimately, cell death.},

abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are nowadays essential tools for a wide range of research topics in the field of radiotherapy. They also play an important role in the effort to develop a real-time monitoring system for quality assurance in proton and carbon ion therapy, by means of prompt-gamma detection. The internal theoretical nuclear models of Monte Carlo simulation toolkits are of decisive importance for the accurate description of neutral or charged particle emission, produced by nuclear interactions between beam particles and target nuclei. We assess the performance of Geant4 nuclear models in the context of prompt-gamma emission, comparing them with experimental data from proton and carbon ion beams. As has been shown in the past and further indicated in our study, the prompt-gamma yields are consistently overestimated by Geant4 by a factor of about 100% to 200% over an energy range from 80 to 310 MeV/u for the case of (12)C, and to a lesser extent for 160 MeV protons. Furthermore, we focus on the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) modeling of ion-ion collisions, in order to optimize its description of light nuclei, which are abundant in the human body and mainly anticipated in hadrontherapy applications. The optimization has been performed by benchmarking QMD free parameters with well established nuclear properties. In addition, we study the effect of this optimization on charged particle emission. With the usage of the proposed parameter values, discrepancies reduce to less than 70%, with the highest values being attributed to the nucleon-ion induced prompt-gammas. This conclusion, also confirmed by the disagreement we observe in the case of proton beams, indicates the need for further investigation on nuclear models which describe proton and neutron induced nuclear reactions.},

Also, image guidance has an increasing role in radiotherapy and MRI is a prime candidate for this imaging. Therefore, in this paper the dosimetric feasibility of Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) in a magnetic field of 1.5 T and the effect on the generated dose distributions compared to those at 0 T is evaluated, using the Monte Carlo software TOol for PArticle Simulation (TOPAS). For three different anatomic sites IMPT plans are generated. It is shown that the generation of an IMPT plan in a magnetic field is feasible, the impact of the magnetic field is small, and the resulting dose distributions are equivalent for 0 T and 1.5 T. Also, the framework of Monte Carlo simulation combined with an inverse optimization method can be used to generate IMPT plans. These plans can be used in future dosimetric comparisons with e.g. IMRT and conventional IMPT. Finally, this study shows that IMPT in a 1.5 T magnetic field is dosimetrically feasible.},

abstract = {When delivering conventional intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), discrepancies between the pre-treatment CT/MRI/PET based patient geometry and the daily patient geometry are minimized by performing couch translations and/or small rotations. However, full compensation of, in particular, rotations is usually not possible. In this paper, we introduce an online 'virtual couch shift (VCS)': we translate and/or rotate the pre-treatment dose distribution to compensate for the changes in patient anatomy and generate a new plan which delivers the transformed dose distribution automatically. We show for a phantom and a cervical cancer patient case that VCS accounts for both translations and large rotations equally well in terms of DVH results and 2%/2 mm $\gamma$ analyses and when the various aspects of the clinical workflow can be implemented successfully, VCS can potentially outperform physical couch translations and/or rotations. This work is performed in the context of our hybrid 1.5 T MRI linear accelerator, which can provide translations and rotations but also deformations of the anatomy. The VCS is the first step toward compensating all of these anatomical changes by online re-optimization of the IMRT dose distribution.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of carbon ion radiotherapy in chordomas of the skull base. Methods and Materials: Between November 1998 and July 2005, a total of 96 patients with chordomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft f??r Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors. Median total dose was 60 CGE (range, 60-70 CGE) delivered in 20 fractions within 3 weeks. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. Results: Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-91 months). Fifteen patients developed local recurrences after carbon ion RT. The actuarial local control rates were 80.6% and 70.0% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Target doses in excess of 60 CGE and primary tumor status were associated with higher local control rates. Overall survival was 91.8% and 88.5% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Late toxicity consisted of optic nerve neuropathy RTOG/EORTC Grade 3 in 4.1% of the patients and necrosis of a fat plomb in 1 patient. Minor temporal lobe injury (RTOG/EORTC Grade 1-2) occurred in 7 patients (7.2%). Conclusions: Carbon ion RT offers an effective treatment option for skull-base chordomas with acceptable toxicity. Doses in excess of 75 CGE with 2 CGE per fraction are likely to increase local control probability. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Second, to show that the SSC requires that T(x) be nonlocal: Besides material properties and energy at the point of interest, it must depend in some fashion on how much multiple scattering has already taken place. Third, after reviewing five previous formulas (three local and two nonlocal), to derive an improved "differential Moli{\`{e}}re" formula T(dM). Last, to investigate, by studying some practical cases, when an accurate formula for T is actually needed. METHODS: We first take the numerical derivative of the Moli{\`{e}}re/Fano/Hanson (theta2) in order to find the true SSC. We simplify the formula for T(IC) (ICRU Report 35) for protons, introducing a new material dependent property, the "scattering length" X(s), analogous to radiation length X(0). We then use T(IC) as a basis for T(dM) by including a nonlocal correction factor fdM which, by virtue of the {\O}ver{\aa}s approximation, parametrizes the single scattering correction. RESULTS: The improved scattering power is T(dM)[triple band]f(dM)(pv,p1v1) x (E(s)/pv)(2)1/X(s) where fdM 0.5244+0.1975 lg(1-(pv/p1v1)2)+0.2320 lg(pv)-0.0098 lg(pv)lg(1-(pv/p1v1)2), P1v1 (MeV) is the initial product of proton momentum and speed, pv is the same at the point of interest, and E(s) = 15.0 MeV. T(dM) is easily computed and generalizes readily to mixed slabs because fdM is not material dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Whether an accurate formula for T is required depends very much on the problem at hand. For beam spreading in water, five of the six formulas for T give almost identical results, suggesting that patient dose calculations are insensitive to T. That is not true, however, of beam spreading in Pb. At the opposite extreme, the projected rms beam width at the end of a Pb/Lexan/air stack, analogous to the upstream modulator in a passive beam spreading system, is sensitive to T. In this case a simple experiment would discriminate between all but two of the six formulas discussed. Scattering power applies as much to Monte Carlo as to deterministic transport calculations. Using T in any of its forms will avoid step size dependence. Using the best available T could be important in general purpose Monte Carlo codes, which are expected to give the correct answer to many different problems.},

abstract = {In addition to the physical advantages (Bragg peak), the use of charged particles in cancer therapy can be associated with distinct biological effects compared to X-rays. While heavy ions (densely ionizing radiation) are known to have an energy- and charge-dependent increased Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE), protons should not be very different from sparsely ionizing photons. A slightly increased biological effectiveness is taken into account in proton treatment planning by assuming a fixed RBE of 1.1 for the whole radiation field. However, data emerging from recent studies suggest that, for several end points of clinical relevance, the biological response is differentially modulated by protons compared to photons. In parallel, research in the field of medical physics highlighted how variations in RBE that are currently neglected might actually result in deposition of significant doses in healthy organs. This seems to be relevant in particular for normal tissues in the entrance region and for organs at risk close behind the tumor. All these aspects will be considered and discussed in this review, highlighting how a re-discussion of the role of a variable RBE in proton therapy might be well-timed.},

In order to guarantee a precise treatment, it is important to obtain the relationship between CT Hounsfield units and electron densities (or proton stopping powers for proton radiotherapy), which is the basic input for radiotherapy planning systems which consider tissue heterogeneities. A method is described to determine improved CT calibrations for biological tissue (a stoichiometric calibration) based on measurements using tissue equivalent materials. The precision of this stoichiometric calibration and the more usual tissue substitute calibration is determined by a comparison of calculated proton radiographic images based on these calibrations and measured radiographs of a biological sample. It has been found that the stoichiometric calibration is more precise than the tissue substitute calibration.},

abstract = {Proton and carbon ion beams have a very sharp Bragg peak. For proton beams of energies smaller than 100 MeV, fitting with a gaussian the region of the maximum of the Bragg peak, the sigma along the beam direction is smaller than 1 mm, while for carbon ion beams, the sigma derived with the same technique is smaller than 1mmfor energies up to 360 MeV. In order to use low energy proton and carbon ion beams in hadrontherapy and to achieve an acceptable homogeneity of the spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) either the peak positions along the beam have to be quite close to each other or the longitudinal peak shape needs to be broaden at least few millimeters by means of a properly designed ripple filter. With a synchrotron accelerator in conjunction with active scanning techniques the use of a ripple filter is necessary to reduce the numbers of energy switches necessary to obtain a smooth SOBP, leading also to shorter overall irradiation times. We studied the impact of the design of the ripple filter on the dose uniformity in the SOBP region by means of Monte Carlo simulations, implemented using the package Geant4. We simulated the beam delivery line supporting both proton and carbon ion beams using different energies of the beams. We compared the effect of different kind of ripple filters and their advantages.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the long-term outcome and toxicity of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for acoustic neuromas in 106 patients treated in a single institution. Patients and Methods: Between October 1989 and January 2004, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) was performed in 106 patients with acoustic neuroma (AN). The median total dose applied was 57.6 Gy in median single fractions of 1.8 Gy in five fractions per week. The median irradiated tumor volume was 3.9 mL (range, 2.7-30.7 mL). The median follow-up time was 48.5 months (range, 3-172 months). Results: Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy was well tolerated in all patients. Actuarial local tumor control rates at 3- and 5- years after FSRT were 94.3% and 93%, respectively. Actuarial useful hearing preservation was 94% at 5 years. The presence of neurofibromatosis (NF-2) significantly adversely influenced hearing preservation in patients that presented with useful hearing at the initiation of RT (p = 0.00062). Actuarial hearing preservation without the diagnosis of NF-2 was 98%. In cases with NF-2, the hearing preservation rate was 64%. Cranial nerve toxicity other than hearing impairment was rare. The rate of radiation induced toxicity to the trigeminal and facial nerve was 3.4% and 2.3%, respectively. Conclusion: Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is safe and efficacious for the treatment of AN, with mild toxicity with regard to hearing loss and cranial nerve function. FSRT might be considered as an equieffective treatment modality compared to neurosurgery and therefore represents an interesting alternative therapy for patients with AN. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose:\r\nDual energy CT (DECT) has recently been proposed as an improvement over single energy CT (SECT) for stopping power ratio (SPR) estimation for proton therapytreatment planning (TP), thereby potentially reducing range uncertainties. Published literature investigated phantoms. This study aims at performing proton therapy TP on SECT and DECT head images of the same patients and at evaluating whether the reported improved DECT SPR accuracy translates into clinically relevant range shifts in clinical head treatment scenarios.\r\nMethods:\r\nTwo phantoms were scanned at a last generation dual source DECT scanner at 90 and 150 kVp with Sn filtration. The first phantom (Gammex phantom) was used to calibrate the scanner in terms of SPR while the second served as evaluation (CIRS phantom). DECT images of five head trauma patients were used as surrogate cancer patient images for TP of proton therapy. Pencil beam algorithm based TP was performed on SECT and DECT images and the dose distributions corresponding to the optimized proton plans were calculated using a Monte Carlo(MC) simulation platform using the same patient geometry for both plans obtained from conversion of the 150 kVp images. Range shifts between the MC dose distributions from SECT and DECT plans were assessed using 2D range maps.\r\nResults:\r\nSPR root mean square errors (RMSEs) for the inserts of the Gammex phantom were 1.9%, 1.8%, and 1.2% for SECT phantom calibration (SECTphantom), SECT stoichiometric calibration (SECTstoichiometric), and DECT calibration, respectively. For the CIRS phantom, these were 3.6%, 1.6%, and 1.0%. When investigating patient anatomy, group median range differences of up to −1.4% were observed for head cases when comparing SECTstoichiometric with DECT. For this calibration the 25th and 75th percentiles varied from −2% to 0% across the five patients. The group median was found to be limited to 0.5% when using SECTphantom and the 25th and 75th percentiles varied from −1% to 2%.\r\nConclusions:\r\nProton therapy TP using a pencil beam algorithm and DECT images was performed for the first time. Given that the DECT accuracy as evaluated by two phantoms was 1.2% and 1.0% RMSE, it is questionable whether the range differences reported here are significant.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the practical implementation of Monte Carlo simulation methods for charged particle transport. The emphasis is on light particles (electrons and positrons) because of the larger scattering and energy straggling effects. Differential cross sections (DCS) for the various interaction mechanisms are described. As the average number of interactions along the particle track increases with the initial energy, detailed simulation becomes unfeasible at high energies. We can then rely on mixed simulation algorithms: hard events (i.e. individual interactions with angular deflection or energy loss larger than given cutoff values) are sampled from the DCS whereas soft events are simulated by means of a multiple scattering approach. Too frequently, the statistical uncertainty of analogue simulation (i.e. strict simulation of the physical interaction process) is found to be so large that results are meaningless. This problem can be partially solved by applying simple variance reduction techniques.},

abstract = {Estimation of collision kerma at a geometric point arising from scattered photons is a potentially important application of Monte Carlo simulation, especially in the presence of steep flux gradients. We examine the usual method of extracting point-kerma estimates from randomly generated photon trajectories which consists of tallying the energy lost by photon collisions occurring in the vicinity of the point of interest. Several other methods derived from the equivalence of track length per unit volume and flux are evaluated as to accuracy and efficiency. Finally, a next-flight estimator is discussed in which the expected contribution of each simulated photon collision to kerma at the point of interest is calculated regardless of proximity of the collision to the point. All of these techniques are shown to involve a trade-off between statistical precision and spatial resolution: increasing the number of contributing collisions requires averaging kerma over a larger volume. Based upon both analytic models and realistic Monte Carlo simulations, use of next-flight and track-length estimators is shown to improve simulation efficiencies by factors of 2 to 20 compared to analog scoring. Practical guidelines as to choice of estimator and successful implementation are presented.},

abstract = {Because proton beams activate positron emitters in patients, positron emission tomography (PET) has the potential to play a unique role in the in vivo verification of proton radiotherapy. Unfortunately, the PET image is not directly proportional to the delivered radiation dose distribution. Current treatment verification strategies using PET therefore compare the actual PET image with full-blown Monte Carlo simulations of the PET signal. In this paper, we describe a simpler and more direct way to reconstruct the expected PET signal from the local radiation dose distribution near the distal fall-off region, which is calculated by the treatment planning programme. Under reasonable assumptions, the PET image can be described as a convolution of the dose distribution with a filter function. We develop a formalism to derive the filter function analytically. The main concept is the introduction of 'Q' functions defined as the convolution of a Gaussian with a powerlaw function. Special Q functions are the Gaussian itself and the error function. The convolution of two Q functions is another Q function. By fitting elementary dose distributions and their corresponding PET signals with Q functions, we derive the Q function approximation of the filter. The new filtering method has been validated through comparisons with Monte Carlo calculations and, in one case, with measured data. While the basic concept is developed under idealized conditions assuming that the absorbing medium is homogeneous near the distal fall-off region, a generalization to inhomogeneous situations is also described. As a result, the method can determine the distal fall-off region of the PET signal, and consequently the range of the proton beam, with millimetre accuracy. Quantification of the produced activity is possible. In conclusion, the PET activity resulting from a proton beam treatment can be determined by locally filtering the dose distribution as obtained from the treatment planning system. The filter function can be calculated analytically using convolutions of Gaussians and powerlaw functions.},

abstract = {The interest in positron emission tomography (PET) as a tool for treatment verification in proton therapy has become widespread in recent years, and several research groups worldwide are currently investigating the clinical implementation. After the first off-line investigation with a PET/CT scanner at MGH (Boston, USA), attention is now focused on an in-room PET application immediately after treatment in order to also detect shorter-lived isotopes, such as O15 and N13, minimizing isotope washout and avoiding patient repositioning errors. Clinical trials are being conducted by means of commercially available PET systems, and other tests are planned using application-dedicated tomographs. Parallel to the experimental investigation and new hardware development, great interest has been shown in the development of fast procedures to provide feedback regarding the delivered dose from reconstructed PET images. Since the thresholds of inelastic nuclear reactions leading to tissue beta+ -activation fall within the energy range of 15-20 MeV, the distal activity fall-off is correlated, but not directly matched, to the distal fall-off of the dose distribution. Moreover, the physical interactions leading to beta+ -activation and energy deposition are of a different nature. All these facts make it essential to further develop accurate and fast methodologies capable of predicting, on the basis of the planned dose distribution, expected PET images to be compared with actual PET measurements, thus providing clinical feedback on the correctness of the dose delivery and of the irradiation field position. The aim of this study has been to validate an analytical model and to implement and evaluate it in a fast and flexible framework able to locally predict such activity distributions directly taking the reference planning CT and planned dose as inputs. The results achieved in this study for phantoms and clinical cases highlighted the potential of the implemented method to predict expected activity distributions with great accuracy. Thus, the analytical model can be used as a powerful substitute method to the sensitive and time-consuming Monte Carlo approach.},

In this method the primary particles are tracked backward from the sensitive part of the geometry till the external source surface by following the reverse processes. By this way the computing time is spent only for tracks that are contributing to the tallies and the reverse Monte Carlo method is much more rapid than the normal forward Monte Carlo method for simulation cases where the sensitive part is small compared to the rest of the geometry and compared to the extended external source. In this paper we first present the theoretical principles of the Reverse Monte Carlo method. Then we describe how this method and the reverse processes have been implemented into Geant4. Finally we compare and discuss the simulation results obtained with the reverse and forward Monte Carlo modes in Geant4. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We study the energy deposited by swift proton beams on materials of biological interest, such as liquid water, DNA, and PMMA. An appropriate description of the target energy-loss function, which provides its electronic excitation spectrum, is obtained from available experimental optical data properly extended to non-vanishing momentum transfers. The main magnitudes characterizing the energy-loss distribution of the beam particles in the target are calculated analytically (in the dielectric framework) and compared with available experimental data. The depth–dose distribution of the energy delivered by the proton beam on the biological targets is simulated by the SEICS (Simulation of Energetic Ions and Clusters through Solids) code, which includes the main interaction phenomena between the projectile and the target constituents by means of Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques. Also, the proton-beam energy distribution at several depths in the target for liquid water and PMMA are simulated, and finally, the properties of PMMA as a water-equivalent material are discussed.},

abstract = {The quality of cancer treatment with protons critically depends on an accurate prediction of the proton stopping powers for the tissues traversed by the protons. Today, treatment planning in proton radiotherapy is based on stopping power calculations from densities of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) images. This causes systematic uncertainties in the calculated proton range in a patient of typically 3–4%, but can become even 10% in bone regions [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. This may lead to no dose in parts of the tumor and too high dose in healthy tissues [1]. A direct measurement of proton stopping powers with high-energy protons will allow reducing these uncertainties and will improve the quality of the treatment. Several studies have shown that a sufficiently accurate radiograph can be obtained by tracking individual protons traversing a phantom (patient) [4,6,10]. Our studies benefit from the gas-filled time projection chambers based on GridPix technology [2], developed at Nikhef, capable of tracking a single proton. A BaF 2 crystal measuring the residual energy of protons was used. Proton radiographs of phantom consisting of different tissue-like materials were measured with a 30×30 mm 2 150 MeV proton beam. Measurements were simulated with the Geant4 toolkit.First experimental and simulated energy radiographs are in very good agreement [3]. In this paper we focus on simulation studies of the proton scattering angle as it affects the position resolution of the proton energy loss radiograph. By selecting protons with a small scattering angle, the image quality can be improved significantly.},

abstract = {The only method for in vivo dose delivery verification in proton beam radiotherapy in clinical use today is positron emission tomography (PET) of the positron emitters produced in the patient during irradiation. PET imaging while the beam is on (so called beam-on PET) is an attractive option, providing the largest number of counts, the least biological washout and the fastest feedback. In this implementation, all nuclides, independent of their half-life, will contribute. As a first step towards assessing the relevance of short-lived nuclides (half-life shorter than that of 10C, T1/2 = 19 s) for in vivo dose delivery verification using beam-on PET, we measured their production in the stopping of 55 MeV protons in water, carbon, phosphorus and calcium The most copiously produced short-lived nuclides and their production rates relative to the relevant long-lived nuclides are: 12N (T1/2 = 11 ms) on carbon (9% of 11C), 29P (T1/2 = 4.1 s) on phosphorus (20% of 30P) and 38mK (T1/2 = 0.92 s) on calcium (113% of 38gK). No short-lived nuclides are produced on oxygen. The number of decays integrated from the start of an irradiation as a function of time during the irradiation of PMMA and 4 tissue materials has been determined. For (carbon-rich) adipose tissue, 12N dominates up to 70 s. On bone tissue, 12N dominates over 15O during the first 8-15 s (depending on carbon-to-oxygen ratio). The short-lived nuclides created on phosphorus and calcium provide 2.5 times more beam-on PET counts than the long-lived ones produced on these elements during a 70 s irradiation. From the estimated number of 12N PET counts, we conclude that, for any tissue, 12N PET imaging potentially provides equal to superior proton range information compared to prompt gamma imaging with an optimized knife-edge slit camera. The practical implementation of 12N PET imaging is discussed.},

abstract = {It is an on-going challenge to verify the proton range in situ during proton therapy. Since the protons stop in target tissue, measurement of gamma-rays emitted either promptly from nuclear de-excitation or in pair from positron annihilation is the feasible method to monitor the proton range in-vivo. Using the technique of gamma collimation, we empirically demonstrated that the proton range and prompt gamma distribution are well correlated in the therapy energy range, and that measuring prompt gammas is a viable method for the clinical application. However, this collimation technique appears not to be applicable to passively scattered proton beams. The device chosen for gamma imaging in 2D is an electron tracking Compton camera, which images single-emission photons employing a gas chamber to induce Compton scattering. Images of prompt gammas were attained at the proton beam energy of 140 MeV. Measurements showed that gamma image in the energy range of 800-2000 keV provides a better match with the proton range compared to the image by lower energy gammas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The advantages of a finite range of proton beams can only be partly exploited in radiation therapy unless the range can be predicted in patient anatomy with <2 mm accuracy (for non-moving targets). Monte Carlo dose calculation aims at 1-2 mm accuracy in dose prediction, and proton-induced PET imaging aims at ∼2 mm accuracy in range verification. The latter is done using Monte Carlo predicted PET images. Monte Carlo methods are based on CT images to describe patient anatomy. The dose calculation algorithm and the CT resolution/artifacts might affect dose calculation accuracy. Additionally, when using Monte Carlo for PET range verification, the biological decay model and the cross sections for positron emitter production affect predicted PET images. The goal of this work is to study the effect of uncertainties in the CT conversion on the proton beam range predicted by Monte Carlo dose calculations and proton-induced PET signals. Conversion schemes to assign density and elemental composition based on a CT image of the patient define a unique Hounsfield unit (HU) to tissue parameters relationship. Uncertainties are introduced because there is no unique relationship between HU and tissue parameters. In this work, different conversion schemes based on a stoichiometric calibration method as well as different numbers of tissue bins were considered in three head and neck patients. For Monte Carlo dose calculation, the results show close to zero (<0.5 mm) differences in range using different conversion schemes. Further, a reduction of the number of bins used to define individual tissues down to 13 did not affect the accuracy. In the case of simulated PET images we found a more pronounced sensitivity on the CT conversion scheme with a mean fall-off position variation of about 1 mm. We conclude that proton dose distributions based on Monte Carlo calculation are only slightly affected by the uncertainty on density and elemental composition introduced by unique assignment to each HU if a stoichiometric calibration is used. Calculated PET images used for range verification are more sensitive to conversion uncertainties causing an intrinsic limitation due to CT conversion alone of at least 1 mm.},

abstract = {Monte Carlo (MC) methods are recognized as the gold-standard for dose calculation, however they have not replaced analytical methods up to now due to their lengthy calculation times. GPU-based applications allow MC dose calculations to be performed on time scales comparable to conventional analytical algorithms. This study focuses on validating our GPU-based MC code for proton dose calculation (gPMC) using an experimentally validated multi-purpose MC code (TOPAS) and compare their performance for clinical patient cases. Clinical cases from five treatment sites were selected covering the full range from very homogeneous patient geometries (liver) to patients with high geometrical complexity (air cavities and density heterogeneities in head-and-neck and lung patients) and from short beam range (breast) to large beam range (prostate). Both gPMC and TOPAS were used to calculate 3D dose distributions for all patients. Comparisons were performed based on target coverage indices (mean dose, V95, D98, D50, D02) and gamma index distributions. Dosimetric indices differed less than 2% between TOPAS and gPMC dose distributions for most cases. Gamma index analysis with 1%/1 mm criterion resulted in a passing rate of more than 94% of all patient voxels receiving more than 10% of the mean target dose, for all patients except for prostate cases. Although clinically insignificant, gPMC resulted in systematic underestimation of target dose for prostate cases by 1-2% compared to TOPAS. Correspondingly the gamma index analysis with 1%/1 mm criterion failed for most beams for this site, while for 2%/1 mm criterion passing rates of more than 94.6% of all patient voxels were observed. For the same initial number of simulated particles, calculation time for a single beam for a typical head and neck patient plan decreased from 4 CPU hours per million particles (2.8-2.9 GHz Intel X5600) for TOPAS to 2.4 s per million particles (NVIDIA TESLA C2075) for gPMC. Excellent agreement was demonstrated between our fast GPU-based MC code (gPMC) and a previously extensively validated multi-purpose MC code (TOPAS) for a comprehensive set of clinical patient cases. This shows that MC dose calculations in proton therapy can be performed on time scales comparable to analytical algorithms with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art CPU-based MC codes.},

abstract = {The goal of this work was to facilitate the clinical use of Monte Carlo proton dose calculation to support routine treatment planning and delivery. The Monte Carlo code Geant4 was used to simulate the treatment head setup, including a time-dependent simulation of modulator wheels (for broad beam modulation) and magnetic field settings (for beam scanning). Any patient-field-specific setup can be modeled according to the treatment control system of the facility. The code was benchmarked against phantom measurements. Using a simulation of the ionization chamber reading in the treatment head allows the Monte Carlo dose to be specified in absolute units (Gy per ionization chamber reading). Next, the capability of reading CT data information was implemented into the Monte Carlo code to model patient anatomy. To allow time-efficient dose calculation, the standard Geant4 tracking algorithm was modified. Finally, a software link of the Monte Carlo dose engine to the patient database and the commercial planning system was established to allow data exchange, thus completing the implementation of the proton Monte Carlo dose calculation engine ('DoC++'). Monte Carlo re-calculated plans are a valuable tool to revisit decisions in the planning process. Identification of clinically significant differences between Monte Carlo and pencil-beam-based dose calculations may also drive improvements of current pencil-beam methods. As an example, four patients (29 fields in total) with tumors in the head and neck regions were analyzed. Differences between the pencil-beam algorithm and Monte Carlo were identified in particular near the end of range, both due to dose degradation and overall differences in range prediction due to bony anatomy in the beam path. Further, the Monte Carlo reports dose-to-tissue as compared to dose-to-water by the planning system. Our implementation is tailored to a specific Monte Carlo code and the treatment planning system XiO (Computerized Medical Systems Inc.). However, this work describes the general challenges and considerations when implementing proton Monte Carlo dose calculation in a clinical environment. The presented solutions can be easily adopted for other planning systems or other Monte Carlo codes.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the impact of approximations in current analytical dose calculation methods (ADCs) on tumor control probability (TCP) in proton therapy. Methods: Dose distributions planned with ADC were compared with delivered dose distributions as determined by Monte Carlo simulations. A total of 50 patients were investigated in this analysis with 10 patients per site for 5 treatment sites (head and neck, lung, breast, prostate, liver). Differences were evaluated using dosimetric indices based on a dose-volume histogram analysis, a ??-index analysis, and estimations of TCP. Results: We found that ADC overestimated the target doses on average by 1% to 2% for all patients considered. The mean dose, D95, D50, and D02 (the dose value covering 95%, 50% and 2% of the target volume, respectively) were predicted within 5% of the delivered dose. The ??-index passing rate for target volumes was above 96% for a 3%/3 mm criterion. Differences in TCP were up to 2%, 2.5%, 6%, 6.5%, and 11% for liver and breast, prostate, head and neck, and lung patients, respectively. Differences in normal tissue complication probabilities for bladder and anterior rectum of prostate patients were less than 3%. Conclusion: Our results indicate that current dose calculation algorithms lead to underdosage of the target by as much as 5%, resulting in differences in TCP of up to 11%. To ensure full target coverage, advanced dose calculation methods like Monte Carlo simulations may be necessary in proton therapy. Monte Carlo simulations may also be required to avoid biases resulting from systematic discrepancies in calculated dose distributions for clinical trials comparing proton therapy with conventional radiation therapy.},

However, in order to maximise the exploitation of its potentialities, online monitoring is required in order to assert the treatment quality, namely monitoring devices relying on the detection of secondary radiations. Herein is presented a method based on Monte Carlo simulations to optimise a multi-slit collimated camera employing time-of-flight selection of prompt-gamma rays to be used in a clinical scenario. In addition, an analytical tool is developed based on the Monte Carlo data to predict the expected precision for a given geometrical configuration. Such a method follows the clinical workflow requirements to simultaneously have a solution that is relatively accurate and fast. Two different camera designs are proposed, considering different endpoints based on the trade-off between camera detection efficiency and spatial resolution to be used in a proton therapy treatment with active dose delivery and assuming a homogeneous target.},

abstract = {A Monte Carlo (MC) variance reduction technique is developed for prompt-gamma emitters calculations in proton therapy. Prompt-gamma emitted through nuclear fragmentation reactions and exiting the patient during proton therapy could play an important role to help monitoring the treatment. However, the estimation of the number and the energy of emitted prompt-gamma per primary proton with MC simulations is a slow process. In order to estimate the local distribution of prompt-gamma emission in a volume of interest for a given proton beam of the treatment plan, a MC variance reduction technique based on a specific track length estimator (TLE) has been developed. First an elemental database of prompt-gamma emission spectra is established in the clinical energy range of incident protons for all elements in the composition of human tissues. This database of the prompt-gamma spectra is built offline with high statistics. Regarding the implementation of the prompt-gamma TLE MC tally, each proton deposits along its track the expectation of the prompt-gamma spectra from the database according to the proton kinetic energy and the local material composition. A detailed statistical study shows that the relative efficiency mainly depends on the geometrical distribution of the track length. Benchmarking of the proposed prompt-gamma TLE MC technique with respect to an analogous MC technique is carried out. A large relative efficiency gain is reported, ca. 10(5).},

A variety of amorphous silicon based panels employing different scintillators were modelled to determine their response to a variety of x-ray spectra and produce an optimized portal imaging system. This study has shown that in a low Z configuration the vast majority of x-rays are produced in the nickel electron window, and with a combination of a carbon insert and caesium iodide based XVI-panel, significant improvement in the object contrast was achieved. For thin, head and neck-type geometries, contrast is 4.62 times greater for 1.6 cm bone in 5.8 cm water than the standard 6 MV/iViewGT system. For thicker, pelvis-type geometries contrast increases by a factor of 1.3 for 1.6 cm of bone in 25.8 cm water. To obtain images with the same signal-to-noise ratio as the 6 MV/iViewGT system, dose reductions of a factor of 15 and 4.2 are possible for 5.8 cm and 25.8 cm phantoms respectively. This design has the advantage of being easily implemented on a standard linac and provides a portal image directly from the therapy beam aperture.},

abstract = {Background and purpose To improve precision of particle therapy, in vivo range verification is highly desirable. Methods based on prompt gamma rays emitted during treatment seem promising but have not yet been applied clinically. Here we report on the worldwide first clinical application of prompt gamma imaging (PGI) based range verification. Material and methods A prototype of a knife-edge shaped slit camera was used to measure the prompt gamma ray depth distribution during a proton treatment of a head and neck tumor for seven consecutive fractions. Inter-fractional variations of the prompt gamma profile were evaluated. For three fractions, in-room control CTs were acquired and evaluated for dose relevant changes. Results The measurement of PGI profiles during proton treatment was successful. Based on the PGI information, inter-fractional global range variations were in the range of ±2 mm for all evaluated fractions. This is in agreement with the control CT evaluation showing negligible range variations of about 1.5 mm. Conclusions For the first time, range verification based on prompt gamma imaging was applied for a clinical proton treatment. With the translation from basic physics experiments into clinical operation, the potential to improve the precision of particle therapy with this technique has increased considerably.},

abstract = {A history by history method for estimating uncertainties has been implemented in the BEAMnrc and DOSXYznrc codes replacing the method of statistical batches. This method groups scored quantities (e.g., dose) by primary history. When phase-space sources are used, this method groups incident particles according to the primary histories that generated them. This necessitated adding markers (negative energy) to phase-space files to indicate the first particle generated by a new primary history. The new method greatly reduces the uncertainty in the uncertainty estimate. The new method eliminates one dimension (which kept the results for each batch) from all scoring arrays, resulting in memory requirement being decreased by a factor of 2. Correlations between particles in phase-space sources are taken into account. The only correlations with any significant impact on uncertainty are those introduced by particle recycling. Failure to account for these correlations can result in a significant underestimate of the uncertainty. The previous method of accounting for correlations due to recycling by placing all recycled particles in the same batch did work. Neither the new method nor the batch method take into account correlations between incident particles when a phase-space source is restarted so one must avoid restarts.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate methods of reporting and analyzing statistical uncertainties in doses to targets and normal tissues in Monte Carlo (MC)-based treatment planning. Methods and Materials: Methods for quantifying statistical uncertainties in dose, such as uncertainty specification to specific dose points, or to volume-based regions, were analyzed in MC-based treatment planning for 5 lung cancer patients. The effect of statistical uncertainties on target and normal tissue dose indices was evaluated. The concept of uncertainty volume histograms for targets and organs at risk was examined, along with its utility, in conjunction with dose volume histograms, in assessing the acceptability of the statistical precision in dose distributions. The uncertainty evaluation tools were extended to four-dimensional planning for application on multiple instances of the patient geometry. All calculations were performed using the Dose Planning Method MC code. Results: For targets, generalized equivalent uniform doses and mean target doses converged at 150 million simulated histories, corresponding to relative uncertainties of less than 2% in the mean target doses. For the normal lung tissue (a volume-effect organ), mean lung dose and normal tissue complication probability converged at 150 million histories despite the large range in the relative organ uncertainty volume histograms. For "serial" normal tissues such as the spinal cord, large fluctuations exist in point dose relative uncertainties. Conclusions: The tools presented here provide useful means for evaluating statistical precision in MC-based dose distributions. Tradeoffs between uncertainties in doses to targets, volume-effect organs, and "serial" normal tissues must be considered carefully in determining acceptable levels of statistical precision in MC-computed dose distributions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Proton range verification based on prompt gamma imaging is increasingly considered in proton therapy. Tissue heterogeneity normal to the beam direction or near the end of range may considerably degrade the ability of prompt gamma imaging to detect proton range shifts. The goal of this study was to systematically investigate the accuracy and precision of range detection from prompt gamma emission profiles for various fractions for intensity modulated proton therapy of prostate cancer, using a comprehensive clinical dataset of 15 different CT scans for 5 patients.Monte Carlo simulations using Geant4 were performed to generate spot-by-spot dose distributions and prompt gamma emission profiles for prostate treatment plans. The prompt gammas were scored at their point of emission. Three CT scans of the same patient were used to evaluate the impact of inter-fractional changes on proton range. The range shifts deduced from the comparison of prompt gamma emission profiles in the planning CT and subsequent CTs were then correlated to the corresponding range shifts deduced from the dose distributions for individual pencil beams. The distributions of range shift differences between prompt gamma and dose were evaluated in terms of precision (defined as half the 95% inter-percentile range IPR) and accuracy (median). In total about 1700 individual proton pencil beams were investigated.The IPR of the relative range shift differences between the dose profiles and the prompt gamma profiles varied between ±1.4 mm and ±2.9 mm when using the more robust profile shifting analysis. The median was found smaller than 1 mm. Methods to identify and reject unreliable spots for range verification due to range mixing were derived and resulted in an average 10% spot rejection, clearly improving the prompt gamma-dose correlation.This work supports that prompt gamma imaging can offer a reliable indicator of range changes due to anatomical variations and tissue heterogeneity in scanning proton treatment of prostate cancer patients when considering prompt gamma emission profiles.},

GATE, the Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission, encapsulates the Geant4 libraries to achieve a modular, versatile, scripted simulation toolkit adapted to the field of nuclear medicine. In particular, GATE allows the description of time-dependent phenomena such as source or detector movement, and source decay kinetics. This feature makes it possible to simulate time curves under realistic acquisition conditions and to test dynamic reconstruction algorithms. This paper gives a detailed description of the design and development of GATE by the OpenGATE collaboration, whose continuing objective is to improve, document and validate GATE by simulating commercially available imaging systems for PET and SPECT. Large effort is also invested in the ability and the flexibility to model novel detection systems or systems still under design.

Imaging of proton-induced prompt gamma (PG) rays using a knife-edge slit collimator is currently under investigation as a potential tool for real-time proton range monitoring. A major challenge in collimated PG imaging is the suppression of neutron-induced background counts. In this work, we present an initial performance test of two knife-edge slit camera prototypes based on arrays of digital photon counters (DPCs). PG profiles emitted from a PMMA target upon irradiation with a 160 MeV proton pencil beams (about 6.5   ×   109 protons delivered in total) were measured using detector modules equipped with four DPC arrays coupled to BGO or LYSO : Ce crystal matrices. The knife-edge slit collimator and detector module were placed at 15 cm and 30 cm from the beam axis, respectively, in all cases. The use of LYSO : Ce enabled time-of-flight (TOF) rejection of background events, by synchronizing the DPC readout electronics with the 106 MHz radiofrequency signal of the cyclotron. The signal-to-background (S/B) ratio of 1.6 obtained with a 1.5 ns TOF window and a 3 MeV–7 MeV energy window was about 3 times higher than that obtained with the same detector module without TOF discrimination and 2 times higher than the S/B ratio obtained with the BGO module. Even 1 mm shifts of the Bragg peak position translated into clear and consistent shifts of the PG profile if TOF discrimination was applied, for a total number of protons as low as about 6.5   ×   108 and a detector surface of 6.6 cm  ×  6.6 cm.},

abstract = {The accuracy of radiopharmaceutical absorbed dose distributions computed through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is mostly limited by the low spatial resolution of 3D imaging techniques used to define the simulation geometry. This issue also persists with the implementation of realistic hybrid models built using polygonal mesh and/or NURBS as they require to be simulated in their voxel form in order to reduce computation times. The existing trade-off between voxel size and simulation speed leads on one side, in an overestimation of the size of small radiosensitive structures such as the skin or hollow organs walls and, on the other, to unnecessarily detailed voxelization of large, homogeneous structures.We developed a set of computational tools based on VTK and Geant4 in order to build multi-resolution organ models. Our aim is to use different voxel sizes to represent anatomical regions of different clinical relevance: the MC implementation of these models is expected to improve spatial resolution in specific anatomical structures without significantly affecting simulation speed. Here we present the tools developed through a proof of principle example. Our approach is validated against the standard Geant4 technique for the simulation of voxel geometries.},

abstract = { Positron emission tomography (PET) is currently the only feasible method for in-situ and noninvasive three-dimensional monitoring of the precision of the treatment in highly conformal ion therapy. Its positive clinical impact has been proven for fractionated carbon ion therapy of head and neck (H&N) tumors at the experimental facility at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, Germany. Following previous promising experiments, the possible extension of the method to the monitoring of proton therapy has been investigated further in extensive in-beam measurements at GSI. Millimeter accuracy for verification of the lateral field position and for the most challenging issue of range monitoring has been demonstrated in monoenergetic and spread-out Bragg-peak (SOBP) proton irradiation of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) targets. The irradiation of an inhomogeneous phantom with tissue equivalent inserts in combination with further dynamic analysis has supported the extension of such millimeter precision to real clinical cases, at least in regions of interest for low perfused tissues. All the experimental investigations have been reproduced by the developed modeling rather well. This indicates the possible extraction of valuable clinical information as particle range in-vivo, irradiation field position, and even local deviations from the dose prescription on the basis of the comparison between measured and predicted activity distributions. Hence, the clinical feasibility of in-beam PET for proton therapy monitoring is strongly supported.},

abstract = {Clinical investigations on post-irradiation PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) imaging for in vivo verification of treatment delivery and, in particular, beam range in proton therapy are underway at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Within this project, we have developed a Monte Carlo framework for CT-based calculation of dose and irradiation-induced positron emitter distributions. Initial proton beam information is provided by a separate Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation modelling the treatment head. Particle transport in the patient is performed in the CT voxel geometry using the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The implementation uses a discrete number of different tissue types with composition and mean density deduced from the CT scan. Scaling factors are introduced to account for the continuous Hounsfield unit dependence of the mass density and of the relative stopping power ratio to water used by the treatment planning system (XiO (Computerized Medical Systems Inc.)). Resulting Monte Carlo dose distributions are generally found in good correspondence with calculations of the treatment planning program, except a few cases (e.g. in the presence of air/tissue interfaces). Whereas dose is computed using standard FLUKA utilities, positron emitter distributions are calculated by internally combining proton fluence with experimental and evaluated cross-sections yielding 11C, 15O, 14O, 13N, 38K and 30P. Simulated positron emitter distributions yield PET images in good agreement with measurements. In this paper, we describe in detail the specific implementation of the FLUKA calculation framework, which may be easily adapted to handle arbitrary phase spaces of proton beams delivered by other facilities or include more reaction channels based on additional cross-section data. Further, we demonstrate the effects of different acquisition time regimes (e.g., PET imaging during or after irradiation) on the intensity and spatial distribution of the irradiation-induced beta+-activity signal for the cases of head and neck and para-spinal tumour sites.},

abstract = {Treatments delivered by proton therapy are affected by uncertainties on the range of the beam within the patient, requiring medical physicists to add safety margins on the penetration depth of the beam. To reduce these margins and deliver safer treatments, different projects are currently investigating real-time range control by imaging prompt gammas emitted along the proton tracks in the patient. This study reports on the feasibility, development and test of a new concept of prompt gamma camera using a slit collimator to obtain a one-dimensional projection of the beam path on a scintillation detector. This concept was optimized, using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX version 2.5.0, to select high energy photons correlated with the beam range and detect them with both high statistics and sufficient spatial resolution. To validate the Monte Carlo model, spectrometry measurements of secondary particles emitted by a PMMA target during proton irradiation at 160 MeV were realized. An excellent agreement with the simulations was observed when using subtraction methods to isolate the gammas in direct incidence. A first prototype slit camera using the HiCam gamma detector was consequently prepared and tested successfully at 100 and 160 MeV beam energies. Results confirmed the potential of this concept for real-time range monitoring with millimetre accuracy in pencil beam scanning mode for typical clinical conditions. If we neglect electronic dead times and rejection of detected events, the current solution with its collimator at 15 cm from the beam axis can achieve a 1-2 mm standard deviation on range estimation in a homogeneous PMMA target for numbers of protons that correspond to doses in water at the Bragg peak as low as 15 cGy at 100 MeV and 25 cGy at 160 MeV assuming pencil beams with a Gaussian profile of 5 mm sigma at target entrance.},

This correlation, together with a high counting rate, paves the way toward real-time monitoring of the longitudinal dose profile during ion therapy treatments.

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to describe the University of Texas M. D. Anderson proton therapy system (PTC-H) including the accelerator, beam transport, and treatment delivery systems, the functionality and clinical parameters for passive scattering and pencil beam scanning treatment modes, and the results of acceptance tests. METHODS: The PTC-H has a synchrotron (70-250 MeV) and four treatment rooms. An overall control system manages the treatment, physics, and service modes of operation. An independent safety system ensures the safety of patients, staff, and equipment. Three treatment rooms have isocentric gantries and one room has two fixed horizontal beamlines, which include a large-field treatment nozzle, used primarily for prostate treatments, and a small-field treatment nozzle for ocular treatments. Two gantry treatment rooms and the fixed-beam treatment room have passive scattering nozzles. The third gantry has a pencil beam scanning nozzle for the delivery of intensity modulated proton treatments (IMPT) and single field uniform dose (SFUD) treatments. The PTC-H also has an experimental room with a fixed horizontal beamline and a passive scattering nozzle. The equipment described above was provided by Hitachi, Ltd. Treatment planning is performed using the Eclipse system from Varian Medical Systems and data management is handled by the MOSAIQ system from IMPAC Medical Systems, Inc. The large-field passive scattering nozzles use double scattering systems in which the first scatterers are physically integrated with the range modulation wheels. The proton beam is gated on the rotating range modulation wheels at gating angles designed to produce spread-out-Bragg peaks ranging in size from 2 to 16 g/cm2. Field sizes of up to 25 x 25 cm2 can be achieved with the double scattering system. The IMPT delivery technique is discrete spot scanning, which has a maximum field size of 30 x 30 cm2. Depth scanning is achieved by changing the energy extracted from the synchrotron (energy can be changed pulse to pulse). The PTC-H is fully integrated with DICOM-RT ION interfaces for imaging, treatment planning, data management, and treatment control functions. RESULTS: The proton therapy system passed all acceptance tests for both passive scattering and pencil beam scanning. Treatments with passive scattering began in May 2006 and treatments with the scanning system began in May 2008. The PTC-H was the first commercial system to demonstrate capabilities for IMPT treatments and the first in the United States to treat using SFUD techniques. The facility has been in clinical operation since May 2006 with up-time of approximately 98%. CONCLUSIONS: As with most projects for which a considerable amount of new technology is developed and which have duration spanning several years, at project completion it was determined that several upgrades would improve the overall system performance. Some possible upgrades are discussed. Overall, the system has been very robust, accurate, reproducible, and reliable. The authors found the pencil beam scanning system to be particularly satisfactory; prostate treatments can be delivered on the scanning nozzle in less time than is required on the passive scattering nozzle.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe a summary of the clinical commissioning of the discrete spot scanning proton beam at the Proton Therapy Center, Houston (PTC-H). METHODS: Discrete spot scanning system is composed of a delivery system (Hitachi ProBeat), an electronic medical record (Mosaiq V 1.5), and a treatment planning system (TPS) (Eclipse V 8.1). Discrete proton pencil beams (spots) are used to deposit dose spot by spot and layer by layer for the proton distal ranges spanning from 4.0 to 30.6 g/cm2 and over a maximum scan area at the isocenter of 30 x 30 cm2. An arbitrarily chosen reference calibration condition has been selected to define the monitor units (MUs). Using radiochromic film and ion chambers, the authors have measured spot positions, the spot sizes in air, depth dose curves, and profiles for proton beams with various energies in water, and studied the linearity of the dose monitors. In addition to dosimetric measurements and TPS modeling, significant efforts were spent in testing information flow and recovery of the delivery system from treatment interruptions. RESULTS: The main dose monitors have been adjusted such that a specific amount of charge is collected in the monitor chamber corresponding to a single MU, following the IAEA TRS 398 protocol under a specific reference condition. The dose monitor calibration method is based on the absolute dose per MU, which is equivalent to the absolute dose per particle, the approach used by other scanning beam institutions. The full width at half maximum for the spot size in air varies from approximately 1.2 cm for 221.8 MeV to 3.4 cm for 72.5 MeV. The measured versus requested 90% depth dose in water agrees to within 1 mm over ranges of 4.0-30.6 cm. The beam delivery interlocks perform as expected, guarantying the safe and accurate delivery of the planned dose. CONCLUSIONS: The dosimetric parameters of the discrete spot scanning proton beam have been measured as part of the clinical commissioning program, and the machine is found to function in a safe manner, making it suitable for patient treatment.},

abstract = {Therapeutic proton and heavier ion beams generate prompt gamma photons that may escape from the patient. In principle, this allows for real-time, in situ monitoring of the treatment delivery, in particular, the hadron range within the patient, by imaging the emitted prompt gamma rays. Unfortunately, the neutrons simultaneously created with the prompt photons create a background that may obscure the prompt gamma signal. To enhance the accuracy of proton dose verification by prompt gamma imaging, we therefore propose a time-of-flight (TOF) technique to reject this neutron background, involving a shifting time window to account for the propagation of the protons through the patient. Time-resolved Monte Carlo simulations of the generation and transport of prompt gamma photons and neutrons upon irradiation of a PMMA phantom with 100, 150 and 200 MeV protons were performed using Geant4 (version 9.2.p02) and MCNPX (version 2.7.D). The influence of angular collimation and TOF selection on the prompt gamma and neutron longitudinal profiles is studied. Furthermore, the implications of the proton beam microstructure (characterized by the proton bunch width and repetition period) are investigated. The application of a shifting TOF window having a width of $\Delta$TOF(z) = 1.0 ns appears to reduce the neutron background by more than 99%. Subsequent application of an energy threshold does not appear to sharpen the distal falloff of the prompt gamma profile but reduces the tail that is observed beyond the proton range. Investigations of the influence of the beam time structure show that TOF rejection of the neutron background is expected to be effective for typical therapeutic proton cyclotrons.},

abstract = {In this work, we present experimental results of a novel prompt gamma-ray detector for proton beam range verification. The detection system features an actively shielded cerium-doped lanthanum(III) bromide scintillator, coupled to a digital data acquisition system. The acquisition was synchronized to the cyclotron radio frequency to separate the prompt gamma-ray signals from the later-arriving neutron-induced background. We designed the detector to provide a high energy resolution and an effective reduction of background events, enabling discrete proton-induced prompt gamma lines to be resolved. Measuring discrete prompt gamma lines has several benefits for range verification. As the discrete energies correspond to specific nuclear transitions, the magnitudes of the different gamma lines have unique correlations with the proton energy and can be directly related to nuclear reaction cross sections. The quantification of discrete gamma lines also enables elemental analysis of tissue in the beam path, providing a better prediction of prompt gamma-ray yields. We present the results of experiments in which a water phantom was irradiated with proton pencil-beams in a clinical proton therapy gantry. A slit collimator was used to collimate the prompt gamma-rays, and measurements were performed at 27 positions along the path of proton beams with ranges of 9, 16 and 23 g cm(-2) in water. The magnitudes of discrete gamma lines at 4.44, 5.2 and 6.13 MeV were quantified. The prompt gamma lines were found to be clearly resolved in dimensions of energy and time, and had a reproducible correlation with the proton depth-dose curve. We conclude that the measurement of discrete prompt gamma-rays for in vivo range verification of clinical proton beams is feasible, and plan to further study methods and detector designs for clinical use.},

abstract = {The measurement of prompt gamma rays emitted from proton-induced nuclear reactions has been proposed as a method to verify in vivo the range of a clinical proton radiotherapy beam. A good understanding of the prompt gamma-ray emission during proton therapy is key to develop a clinically feasible technique, as it can facilitate accurate simulations and uncertainty analysis of gamma detector designs. Also, the gamma production cross-sections may be incorporated as prior knowledge in the reconstruction of the proton range from the measurements. In this work, we performed simulations of proton-induced nuclear reactions with the main elements of human tissue, carbon-12, oxygen-16 and nitrogen-14, using the nuclear reaction models of the GEANT4 and MCNP6 Monte Carlo codes and the dedicated nuclear reaction codes TALYS and EMPIRE. For each code, we made an effort to optimize the input parameters and model selection. The results of the models were compared to available experimental data of discrete gamma line cross-sections. Overall, the dedicated nuclear reaction codes reproduced the experimental data more consistently, while the Monte Carlo codes showed larger discrepancies for a number of gamma lines. The model differences lead to a variation of the total gamma production near the end of the proton range by a factor of about 2. These results indicate a need for additional theoretical and experimental study of proton-induced gamma emission in human tissue.},

abstract = {Proton and ion beams open up new vistas for the curative treatment of tumors, but adequate technologies for monitoring the compliance of dose delivery with treatment plans in real time are still missing. Range assessment, meaning the monitoring of therapy-particle ranges in tissue during dose delivery (treatment), is a continuous challenge considered a key for tapping the full potential of particle therapies. In this context the paper introduces an unconventional concept of range assessment by prompt-gamma timing (PGT), which is based on an elementary physical effect not considered so far: therapy particles penetrating tissue move very fast, but still need a finite transit time-about 1-2 ns in case of protons with a 5-20 cm range-from entering the patient's body until stopping in the target volume. The transit time increases with the particle range. This causes measurable effects in PGT spectra, usable for range verification. The concept was verified by proton irradiation experiments at the AGOR cyclotron, KVI-CART, University of Groningen. Based on the presented kinematical relations, we describe model calculations that very precisely reproduce the experimental results. As the clinical treatment conditions entail measurement constraints (e.g. limited treatment time), we propose a setup, based on clinical irradiation conditions, capable of determining proton range deviations within a few seconds of irradiation, thus allowing for a fast safety survey. Range variations of 2 mm are expected to be clearly detectable.},

abstract = {In-vivo imaging is a strategy to monitor the range of protons inside the patient during radiation treatment. A possible method of in-vivo imaging is detection of secondary 'prompt' gamma (PG) photons outside the body, which are produced by inelastic proton-nuclear interactions inside the patient. In this paper, important parameters influencing the relationship between the PG profile and percentage depth dose (PDD) in a uniform cylindrical phantom are explored. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with the new Geant4 based code TOPAS for mono-energetic proton pencil beams (range: 100-250 MeV) and an idealized PG detector. PG depth profiles are evaluated using the inflection point on a sigmoid fit in the fall-off region of the profile. A strong correlation between the inflection point and the proton range determined from the PDD is found for all conditions. Variations between 1.5 mm and 2.7 mm in the distance between the proton range and the inflection point are found when either the mass density, phantom diameter, or detector acceptance angle is changed. A change in cut-off energy of the detector could induce a range difference of maximum 4 mm. Applying time-of-flight discrimination during detection, changing the primary energy of the beam or changing the elemental composition of the tissue affects the accuracy of the range prediction by less than 1 mm. The results indicate that the PG signal is rather robust to many parameter variations, but millimetre accurate range monitoring requires all medium and detector properties to be carefully taken into account.},

Overall efficiency gains of the TLE with respect to analogous MC were reported in the literature for regions of interest in various applications (photon beam radiation therapy, x-ray imaging). The behaviour of the TLE method in terms of statistical properties, dose deposition patterns, and computational efficiency compared to analogous MC simulations was investigated. The statistical properties of the dose deposition were first assessed. Derivations of the variance reduction factor of TLE versus analogous MC were carried out, starting from the expression of the dose estimate variance in the TLE and analogous MC schemes. Two test cases were chosen to benchmark the TLE performance in comparison with analogous MC: (i) a small animal irradiation under stereotactic synchrotron radiation therapy conditions and (ii) the irradiation of a human pelvis during a cone beam computed tomography acquisition. Dose distribution patterns and efficiency gain maps were analysed. The efficiency gain exhibits strong variations within a given irradiation case, depending on the geometrical (voxel size, ballistics) and physical (material and beam properties) parameters on the voxel scale. Typical values lie between 10 and 103, with lower levels in dense regions (bone) outside the irradiated channels (scattered dose only), and higher levels in soft tissues directly exposed to the beams. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the characteristics of prompt gammas (PGs) emitted from excited nuclei during proton therapy are advantageous for determining beam range during treatment delivery. Since PGs are only emitted while the beam is on, the feasibility of using PGs for online treatment verification depends greatly on the design of highly efficient detectors. The purpose of this work is to characterize how PG detection changes as a function of distance from the patient as a means of guiding the design and usage of clinical PG imaging detectors. Using a Monte Carlo model (GEANT4.9.4) we studied the detection rate (PGs per incident proton) of a high purity germanium detector for both the total PG emission and the characteristic 6.13 MeV PG emission from (16)O emitted during proton irradiation. The PG detection rate was calculated as a function of distance from the isocenter of the proton treatment nozzle for: (1) a water phantom irradiated with a proton pencil beam and (2) a prostate patient irradiated with a scanning beam proton therapy treatment field (lateral field size: ∼6 cm × 6 cm, beam range: 23.5 cm). An analytical expression of the PG detection rate as a function of distance from isocenter, detector size, and proton beam energy was then developed. The detection rates were found to be 1.3 × 10(-6) for oxygen and 3.9 × 10(-4) for the total PG emission, respectively, with the detector placed 11 cm from isocenter for a 40 MeV pencil beam irradiating a water phantom. The total PG detection rate increased by ∼85 ± 3% for beam energies greater than 150 MeV. The detection rate was found to be approximately 2.1 × 10(-6) and 1.7 × 10(-3) for oxygen and total PG emission, respectively, during delivery of a single pencil beam during a scanning beam treatment for prostate cancer. The PG detection rate as a function of distance from isocenter during irradiation of a water phantom with a single proton pencil beam was described well by the model of a point source irradiating a cylindrical detector of a known diameter over the range of beam energies commonly used for proton therapy. For the patient studies, it was necessary to divide the point source equation by an exponential factor in order to correctly predict the falloff of the PG detection rate as a function of distance from isocenter.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work was to compare the clinical adaptation of prompt gamma (PG) imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) as independent tools for non-invasive proton beam range verification and treatment validation. The PG range correlation and its differences with PET have been modeled for the first time in a highly heterogeneous tissue environment, using different field sizes and configurations. Four patients with different tumor locations (head and neck, prostate, spine and abdomen) were chosen to compare the site-specific behaviors of the PG and PET images, using both passive scattered and pencil beam fields. Accurate reconstruction of dose, PG and PET distributions was achieved by using the planning computed tomography (CT) image in a validated GEANT4-based Monte Carlo code capable of modeling the treatment nozzle and patient anatomy in detail. The physical and biological washout phenomenon and decay half-lives for PET activity for the most abundant isotopes such as (11)C, (15)O, (13)N, (30)P and (38)K were taken into account in the data analysis. The attenuation of the gamma signal after traversing the patient geometry and respective detection efficiencies were estimated for both methods to ensure proper comparison. The projected dose, PG and PET profiles along many lines in the beam direction were analyzed to investigate the correlation consistency across the beam width. For all subjects, the PG method showed on average approximately 10 times higher gamma production rates than the PET method before, and 60 to 80 times higher production after including the washout correction and acquisition time delay. This rate strongly depended on tissue density and elemental composition. For broad passive scattered fields, it was demonstrated that large differences exist between PG and PET signal falloff positions and the correlation with the dose distribution for different lines in the beam direction. These variations also depended on the treatment site and the particular subject. Thus, similar to PET, direct range verification with PG in passive scattering is not easily viable. However, upon development of an optimized 3D PG detector, indirect range verification by comparing measured and simulated PG distributions (currently being explored for the PET method) would be more beneficial because it can avoid the inherent biological challenges of the PET imaging. The improved correlation of PG and PET with dose when using pencil beams was evident. PG imaging was found to be potentially advantageous especially for small tumors in the presence of high tissue heterogeneities. Including the effects of detector acceptance and efficiency may hold PET superior in terms of the amplitude of the detected signal (depending on the future development of PG detection technology), but the ability to perform online measurements and avoid signal disintegration (due to washout) with PG are important factors that can outweigh the benefits of higher detection sensitivity.},

abstract = {For real-time monitoring of the longitudinal position of the Bragg-peak during an ion therapy treatment, a novel non-invasive technique has been recently proposed that exploits the detection of prompt gamma-rays issued from nuclear fragmentation. Two series of experiments have been performed at the GANIL and GSI facilities with 95 and 305 MeV/u (12)C(6+) ion beams stopped in PMMA and water phantoms. In both experiments, a clear correlation was obtained between the carbon ion range and the prompt photon profile. Additionally, an extensive study has been performed to investigate whether a prompt neutron component may be correlated with the carbon ion range. No such correlation was found. The present paper demonstrates that a collimated set-up can be used to detect single photons by means of time-of-flight measurements, at those high energies typical for ion therapy. Moreover, the applicability of the technique both at cyclotron and at synchrotron facilities is shown. It is concluded that the detected photon count rates provide sufficiently high statistics to allow real-time control of the longitudinal position of the Bragg-peak under clinical conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A multidisciplinary and multi-institutional working group applied the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) approach to the actively scanned proton beam radiotherapy process implemented at CNAO (Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica), aiming at preventing accidental exposures to the patient.

METHODS: FMEA was applied to the treatment planning stage and consisted of three steps: i) identification of the involved sub-processes; ii) identification and ranking of the potential failure modes, together with their causes and effects, using the risk probability number (RPN) scoring system, iii) identification of additional safety measures to be proposed for process quality and safety improvement. RPN upper threshold for little concern of risk was set at 125.

RESULTS: Thirty-four sub-processes were identified, twenty-two of them were judged to be potentially prone to one or more failure modes. A total of forty-four failure modes were recognized, 52% of them characterized by an RPN score equal to 80 or higher. The threshold of 125 for RPN was exceeded in five cases only. The most critical sub-process appeared related to the delineation and correction of artefacts in planning CT data. Failures associated to that sub-process were inaccurate delineation of the artefacts and incorrect proton stopping power assignment to body regions. Other significant failure modes consisted of an outdated representation of the patient anatomy, an improper selection of beam direction and of the physical beam model or dose calculation grid. The main effects of these failures were represented by wrong dose distribution (i.e. deviating from the planned one) delivered to the patient. Additional strategies for risk mitigation, easily and immediately applicable, consisted of a systematic information collection about any known implanted prosthesis directly from each patient and enforcing a short interval time between CT scan and treatment start. Moreover, (i) the investigation of dedicated CT image reconstruction algorithms, (ii) further evaluation of treatment plan robustness and (iii) implementation of independent methods for dose calculation (such as Monte Carlo simulations) may represent novel solutions to increase patient safety.

CONCLUSIONS: FMEA is a useful tool for prospective evaluation of patient safety in proton beam radiotherapy. The application of this method to the treatment planning stage lead to identify strategies for risk mitigation in addition to the safety measures already adopted in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that during cancer radiotherapy a small translation or rotation of the tumor can lead to errors in dose delivery. Current best practice in radiotherapy accounts for tumor translations, but is unable to address rotation due to a lack of a reliable real-time estimate. We have developed a method based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm that can compute rotation from kilovoltage x-ray images acquired during radiation treatment delivery. A total of 11 748 kilovoltage (kV) images acquired from ten patients (one fraction for each patient) were used to evaluate our tumor rotation algorithm. For each kV image, the three dimensional coordinates of three fiducial markers inside the prostate were calculated. The three dimensional coordinates were used as input to the ICP algorithm to calculate the real-time tumor rotation and translation around three axes. The results show that the root mean square error was improved for real-time calculation of tumor displacement from a mean of 0.97 mm with the stand alone translation to a mean of 0.16 mm by adding real-time rotation and translation displacement with the ICP algorithm. The standard deviation (SD) of rotation for the ten patients was 2.3°, 0.89° and 0.72° for rotation around the right-left (RL), anterior-posterior (AP) and superior-inferior (SI) directions respectively. The correlation between all six degrees of freedom showed that the highest correlation belonged to the AP and SI translation with a correlation of 0.67. The second highest correlation in our study was between the rotation around RL and rotation around AP, with a correlation of -0.33. Our real-time algorithm for calculation of rotation also confirms previous studies that have shown the maximum SD belongs to AP translation and rotation around RL. ICP is a reliable and fast algorithm for estimating real-time tumor rotation which could create a pathway to investigational clinical treatment studies requiring real-time measurement and adaptation to tumor rotation.},

abstract = {Organ motion is a major problem for any dynamic radiotherapy delivery technique, and is particularly so for spot scanned proton therapy. On the other hand, the use of narrow, magnetically deflected proton pencil beams is potentially an ideal delivery technique for tracking tumour motion on-line. At PSI, our new Gantry is equipped with a Beams Eye View (BEV) imaging system which will be able to acquire 2D x-ray images in fluoroscopy mode during treatment delivery. However, besides precisely tracking motion from BEVs, it is also essential to obtain information on the 3D motion vector throughout the whole region of interest, and any sparsely acquired surrogate motion is generally not sufficient to describe the deformable behaviour of the whole volume in three dimensions. In this study, we propose a method by which 3D deformable motions can be estimated from surrogate motions obtained using this monoscopic imaging system. The method assumes that example motions over a number of breathing cycles can be acquired before treatment for each patient using 4DMRI. In this study, for each of 11 different subjects, 100 continuous breathing cycles have been extracted from extended 4DMRI studies in the liver and then subject specific motion models have been built using principle component analysis (PCA). To simulate treatment conditions, a different set of 30 continuous breathing cycles from the same subjects have then been used to generate a set of simulated 4DCT data sets (so-called 4DCT(MRI) data sets), from which time-resolved digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were calculated using the BEV geometry for three treatment fields respectively. From these DRRs, surrogate motions from fiducial markers or the diaphragm have been used as a predictor to estimate 3D motions in the liver region for each subject. The prediction results have been directly compared to the 'ground truth' motions extracted from the same 30 breath cycles of the originating 4DMRI data set. Averaged over all 11 subjects, and for three field directions, for 99% of predicted positions, median (max) error magnitudes of better than 2.63(5.67) mm can be achieved when fiducial markers was chosen as predictor. Furthermore, three single fields, 4D dose calculations have been performed as a verification tool to evaluate the prediction performance of such a model in the context of scanned proton beam therapy. These show a high similarity between plans considering either PCA predicted motion or ground truth motion, where absolute dose differences of more than 5% (Vdosediff = 5%) occur for the worst field scenarios in only 3.61% (median) or 15.13% (max) of dose calculation points in the irradiated volume. The magnitude of these dose differences were insignificantly dependent on whether surrogate motions were tracked by monoscopic or stereoscopic imaging systems, or whether fiducial markers or diaphragm were chosen as surrogate. This study has demonstrated that on-line deformable motion reconstruction from sparse surrogate motions is feasible, even when using only a monoscopic imaging system. In addition, it has also been found that diaphragm motion can be considered as a good predictor for respiratory deformable liver motion prediction, implying that fiducial markers might not be compulsory if used in conjunction with a patient specific PCA based model.},

abstract = {During particle therapy irradiation, positron emitters with half-lives ranging from 2 to 20 min are generated from nuclear processes. The half-lives are such that it is possible either to detect the positron signal in the treatment room using an in-beam positron emission tomography (PET) system, right after the irradiation, or to quickly transfer the patient to a close PET/CT scanner. Since the activity distribution is spatially correlated with the dose, it is possible to use PET imaging as an indirect method to assure the quality of the dose delivery. In this work, we present a new dedicated PET system able to operate in-beam. The PET apparatus consists in two 10 cm × 10 cm detector heads. Each detector is composed of four scintillating matrices of 23 × 23 LYSO crystals. The crystal size is 1.9 mm × 1.9 mm × 16 mm. Each scintillation matrix is read out independently with a modularized acquisition system. The distance between the two opposing detector heads was set to 20 cm. The system has very low dead time per detector area and a 3 ns coincidence window, which is capable to sustain high single count rates and to keep the random counts relatively low. This allows a new full-beam monitoring modality that includes data acquisition also while the beam is on. The PET system was tested during the irradiation at the CATANA (INFN, Catania, Italy) cyclotron-based proton therapy facility. Four acquisitions with different doses and dose rates were analysed. In all cases the random to total coincidences ratio was equal or less than 25%. For each measurement we estimated the accuracy and precision of the activity range on a set of voxel lines within an irradiated PMMA phantom. Results show that the inclusion of data acquired during the irradiation, referred to as beam-on data, improves both the precision and accuracy of the range measurement with respect to data acquired only after irradiation. Beam-on data alone are enough to give precisions better than 1 mm when at least 5 Gy are delivered.},

abstract = {Online dose monitoring in proton therapy is currently being investigated with prompt-gamma (PG) devices. PG emission was shown to be correlated with dose deposition. This relationship is mostly unknown under real conditions. We propose a machine learning approach based on simulations to create optimized treatment-specific classifiers that detect discrepancies between planned and delivered dose. Simulations were performed with the Monte-Carlo platform Gate/Geant4 for a spot-scanning proton therapy treatment and a PG camera prototype currently under investigation. The method first builds a learning set of perturbed situations corresponding to a range of patient translation. This set is then used to train a combined classifier using distal falloff and registered correlation measures. Classifier performances were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and maximum associated specificity and sensitivity. A leave-one-out study showed that it is possible to detect discrepancies of 5 mm with specificity and sensitivity of 85% whereas using only distal falloff decreases the sensitivity down to 77% on the same data set. The proposed method could help to evaluate performance and to optimize the design of PG monitoring devices. It is generic: other learning sets of deviations, other measures and other types of classifiers could be studied to potentially reach better performance. At the moment, the main limitation lies in the computation time needed to perform the simulations.},

The accuracy of the nuclear fragmentation models implemented in these codes might affect the quality of the treatment verification. In this paper, we investigate the nuclear models implemented in GATE/Geant4 and FLUKA by comparing the angular and energy distributions of secondary particles exiting a homogeneous target of PMMA. Comparison results were restricted to fragmentation of (16)O and (12)C. Despite the very simple target and set-up, substantial discrepancies were observed between the two codes. For instance, the number of high energy (>1 MeV) prompt gammas exiting the target was about twice as large with GATE/Geant4 than with FLUKA both for proton and carbon ion beams. Such differences were not observed for the predicted annihilation photon production yields, for which ratios of 1.09 and 1.20 were obtained between GATE and FLUKA for the proton beam and the carbon ion beam, respectively. For neutrons and protons, discrepancies from 14% (exiting protons-carbon ion beam) to 57% (exiting neutrons-proton beam) have been identified in production yields as well as in the energy spectra for neutrons.},

abstract = {Active scanning delivery systems take full advantage of ion beams to best conform to the tumor and to spare surrounding healthy tissues; however, it is also a challenging technique for quality assurance. In this perspective, we upgraded the GATE/GEANT4 Monte Carlo platform in order to recalculate the treatment planning system (TPS) dose distributions for active scanning systems. A method that allows evaluating the TPS dose distributions with the GATE Monte Carlo platform has been developed and applied to the XiO TPS (Elekta), for the IBA proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) system. First, we evaluated the specificities of each dose engine. A dose-conversion scheme that allows one to convert dose to medium into dose to water was implemented within GATE. Specific test cases in homogeneous and heterogeneous configurations allowed for the estimation of the differences between the beam models implemented in XiO and GATE. Finally, dose distributions of a prostate treatment plan were compared. In homogeneous media, a satisfactory agreement was generally obtained between XiO and GATE. The maximum stopping power difference of 3% occurred in a human tissue of 0.9 g cm(-3) density and led to a significant range shift. Comparisons in heterogeneous configurations pointed out the limits of the TPS dose calculation accuracy and the superiority of Monte Carlo simulations. The necessity of computing dose to water in our Monte Carlo code for comparisons with TPSs is also presented. Finally, the new capabilities of the platform are applied to a prostate treatment plan and dose differences between both dose engines are analyzed in detail. This work presents a generic method to compare TPS dose distributions with the GATE Monte Carlo platform. It is noteworthy that GATE is also a convenient tool for imaging applications, therefore opening new research possibilities for the PBS modality.},

abstract = {This work proposes a generic method for modeling scanned ion beam delivery systems, without simulation of the treatment nozzle and based exclusively on beam data library (BDL) measurements required for treatment planning systems (TPS). To this aim, new tools dedicated to treatment plan simulation were implemented in the Gate Monte Carlo platform. The method was applied to a dedicated nozzle from IBA for proton pencil beam scanning delivery. Optical and energy parameters of the system were modeled using a set of proton depth-dose profiles and spot sizes measured at 27 therapeutic energies. For further validation of the beam model, specific 2D and 3D plans were produced and then measured with appropriate dosimetric tools. Dose contributions from secondary particles produced by nuclear interactions were also investigated using field size factor experiments. Pristine Bragg peaks were reproduced with 0.7 mm range and 0.2 mm spot size accuracy. A 32 cm range spread-out Bragg peak with 10 cm modulation was reproduced with 0.8 mm range accuracy and a maximum point-to-point dose difference of less than 2%. A 2D test pattern consisting of a combination of homogeneous and high-gradient dose regions passed a 2%/2 mm gamma index comparison for 97% of the points. In conclusion, the generic modeling method proposed for scanned ion beam delivery systems was applicable to an IBA proton therapy system. The key advantage of the method is that it only requires BDL measurements of the system. The validation tests performed so far demonstrated that the beam model achieves clinical performance, paving the way for further studies toward TPS benchmarking. The method involves new sources that are available in the new Gate release V6.1 and could be further applied to other particle therapy systems delivering protons or other types of ions like carbon.},

A plastic tank filled with liquid scintillator was irradiated with pristine proton Bragg peaks. Scintillation light produced during the irradiation was measured with a CCD camera. Acquisition rates of 20 and 10 frames per second (fps) were used to image consecutive frame sequences. These measurements were then compared to ion chamber measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. The light distribution measured from the images acquired at rates of 20 and 10 fps have standard deviations of 1.1% and 0.7%, respectively, in the plateau region of the Bragg curve. Differences were seen between the raw LS signal and the ion chamber due to the quenching effects of the LS and due to the optical properties of the imaging system. The authors showed that this effect can be accounted for and corrected by Monte Carlo simulations. The liquid scintillator detector system has a good potential for performing fast proton beam verification and characterization.},

abstract = {Progress in radiotherapy is guided by the need to realize improved dose distributions, i.e. the ability to reduce the treatment volume toward the target volume and still ensuring coverage of that target volume in all dimensions. Poor ability to control the tumour's location limits the accuracy with which radiation can be delivered to tumour-bearing tissue. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) aims at in-room imaging guiding the radiation delivery based on instant knowledge of the target location and changes in tumour volume during treatment. Advancements are usually not to be attributed to a single event, but rather a combination of many small improvements that together enable a superior result. Image-guidance is an important link in the treatment chain and as such a major factor in this synergetic process. A historic review shows that many of the so-called new developments are not so new at all, but did not make it into mainstream radiotherapy practice at that time. Recent developments in improved IT infrastructures, novel irradiation techniques, and better knowledge of functional and morphologic information may have created the need and optimal environment to revive the interest in IGRT. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {PURPOSE: In vivo range verification is one of the most important parts of proton therapy to fully utilize its benefits delivering high radiation dose to tumor, while sparing the normal tissue with the so-called Bragg peak. Currently, however, range verification method is not used in clinics. The purpose of the present study is to optimize and evaluate the configuration of an array-type prompt gamma measurement system on determining distal dose edge for in vivo range verification of proton therapy.

METHODS: To effectively measure the prompt gammas against the background gammas, the Monte Carlo simulations with the MCNPX code were employed in optimizing the configuration of the measurement system, and the Monte Carlo method was also used to understand the effect of the background gammas, mainly neutron capture gammas, in the measured gamma distribution. To reduce the effect of the background gammas, the optimized energy window of 4-10 MeV in measuring the prompt gammas was employed. A parameterized source was used to maximize computation speed in the optimization study. A simplified test measurement system, using only one detector moving from one measurement location to the next, was constructed and applied to therapeutic proton beams of 80-220 MeV. For accurate determination of the distal dose edge, the sigmoidal curve-fitting method was applied to the measured distributions of the prompt gammas, and then, the location of the half-value between the maximum and minimum value in the curve-fitting was determined as the distal dose edge and compared with the beam range assessed by the proton dose distribution.

RESULTS: The parameterized source term employed in optimization process improved the calculation speed by up to ∼300 times. The optimization study indicates that an array-type measurement system with 3, 2, 2, and 150 mm for scintillator thickness, slit width, septal thickness, and slit length, respectively, can effectively measure the prompt gamma distributions minimizing the contribution of background gammas. The present results show that a few hundred counts of prompt gammas can be easily obtained by measuring 10 s at each measurement location for proton beams of ∼4 nA. The distal dose edges determined by the prompt gamma distribution are 5.45, 14.73, and 27.74 cm for proton beams of 5.17 (80 MeV), 14.99 (150 MeV), and 27.38 (220 MeV) cm, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the array-type measurement system can measure prompt gamma distributions from a therapeutic proton beam within a short measurement time, and that the distal dose edge can be determined within a few millimeters of error without using any sophisticated analysis.},

abstract = {Technological advances have greatly enhanced the specialty of radiation oncology by allowing more healthy tissue to be spared for the same or better tumour coverage. Developments in medical imaging are integral to radiation oncology, both for design of treatment plans and to localise the target for precise administration of radiation. At planning, definition of the tumour and healthy tissue is based on CT, augmented frequently with MRI and PET. At treatment, three-dimensional soft-tissue imaging can also be used to localise the target and tumour motion can be tracked with fluoroscopic imaging of radio-opaque markers implanted in or near the tumour. These developments allow changes in tumour position, size, and shape that take place during radiotherapy to be measured and accounted for to boost geometric accuracy and precision of radiation delivery. Image-guided treatment also enhances uniformity in doses administered in a population of patients, thus improving our ability to measure the effect of dosimetric and non-dosimetric factors on tumour and healthy tissue outcomes in clinical trials. Increased precision and accuracy of radiotherapy are expected to augment tumour control, reduce incidence and severity of toxic effects after radiotherapy, and facilitate development of more efficient shorter schedules than currently available. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed set-up consists of a stack of 2 mm thick silicon strip detectors and a LYSO absorber detector. The $\gamma$ emission points are reconstructed analytically by intersecting the ion trajectories given by the beam hodoscope and the Compton cones given by the camera. The camera response to a polychromatic point source in air is analyzed with regard to both spatial resolution and detection efficiency. Various geometrical configurations of the camera have been tested. In the proposed configuration, for a typical polychromatic photon point source, the spatial resolution of the camera is about 8.3 mm FWHM and the detection efficiency 2.5×10-4 (reconstructable photons/emitted photons in 4$\pi$). Finally, the clinical applicability of our system is considered and possible starting points for further developments of a prototype are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Knopf2013,
abstract = {Protons are an interesting modality for radiotherapy because of their well defined range and favourable depth dose characteristics. On the other hand, these same characteristics lead to added uncertainties in their delivery. This is particularly the case at the distal end of proton dose distributions, where the dose gradient can be extremely steep. In practice however, this gradient is rarely used to spare critical normal tissues due to such worries about its exact position in the patient. Reasons for this uncertainty are inaccuracies and non-uniqueness of the calibration from CT Hounsfield units to proton stopping powers, imaging artefacts (e.g. due to metal implants) and anatomical changes of the patient during treatment. In order to improve the precision of proton therapy therefore, it would be extremely desirable to verify proton range in vivo, either prior to, during, or after therapy. In this review, we describe and compare state-of-the art in vivo proton range verification methods currently being proposed, developed or clinically implemented.},

However, recent investigations are suggesting that the range can be verified also from the prompt gamma (PG) photon emissions generated from proton interactions. In this work we investigate using the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit the clinical viability of a theoretical sequential detector system to verify the range of protons in proton radiotherapy by the PG method for simple geometries and beam configurations. The results show a correlation between selected emitted PG rays and the incident protons range and suggest that our detector system is capable of in-vivo range monitoring for energies typical of radiation oncology applications. Future work will include implementing more realistic scenarios and optimizing current detector parameters.},

abstract = {Proton imaging can be seen as a powerful technique for online monitoring of ion range during carbon ion therapy irradiations. Indeed, a large number of secondary protons are created during nuclear reactions, and many of these protons are likely to escape from the patient even for deep-seated tumors, carrying accurate information on the reaction vertex position. Two detection techniques have been considered: (i) double-proton detection by means of two forward-located trackers and (ii) single-proton detection in coincidence with the incoming carbon ion detected by means of a beam hodoscope. Geant4 simulations, validated by proton yield measurements performed at GANIL and GSI, show that ion-range monitoring is accessible on a pencil-beam basis with the single-proton imaging technique. Millimetric precision on the Bragg peak position is expected in the ideal case of homogeneous targets. The uncertainties in more realistic conditions should be investigated, in particular the influence of tissue heterogeneity in the very last part of the ion path (about 20 mm).},

abstract = {Hospital-based proton facilities may represent a major advance in radiation therapy, in part because of excellent dose distributions around the tumor, and in part because of the potentially lower whole-body dose compared with photon radiotherapy. Most current proton beams are spread out to cover the tumor using beam scattering and collimation techniques (passive scattering); this will necessarily result in an extra whole-body neutron dose, due to interactions of the protons with the scattering and collimating beam elements. However, the clinical significance of this whole-body low-dose neutron exposure has remained controversial. The number of proton facilities worldwide is increasing rapidly, and most of these facilities are/will be based on passive scattering. Thus it is important to assess and, ideally, minimize, the potential for second cancer induction by secondary neutrons. We discuss here the neutron doses involved, and the associated potential second cancer risks, with an emphasis on the uncertainties involved.},

abstract = {A cone-beam computed tomography (CT) system utilizing a proton beam has been developed and tested. The cone beam is produced by scattering a 160 MeV proton beam with a modifier that results in a signal in the detector system, which decreases monotonically with depth in the medium. The detector system consists of a Gd2O2S:Tb intensifying screen viewed by a cooled CCD camera. The Feldkamp-Davis-Kress cone-beam reconstruction algorithm is applied to the projection data to obtain the CT voxel data representing proton stopping power. The system described is capable of reconstructing data over a 16 x 16 x 16 cm3 volume into 512 x 512 x 512 voxels. A spatial and contrast resolution phantom was scanned to determine the performance of the system. Spatial resolution is significantly degraded by multiple Coulomb scattering effects. Comparison of the reconstructed proton CT values with x-ray CT derived proton stopping powers shows that there may be some advantage to obtaining stopping powers directly with proton CT. The system described suggests a possible practical method of obtaining this measurement in vivo.},

@article{Schneider2011,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Proton radiography and tomography was investigated since the early 1970s because of its low radiation dose, high density resolution and ability to image directly proton stopping power. However, spatial resolution is still a limiting factor and as a consequence experimental methods and image reconstruction should be optimized to improve position resolution. METHODS: Spatial resolution of proton radiography and tomography is given by multiple Coloumb scattering (MCS) of the protons in the patient. In this paper we employ an improved MCS model to study the impact of various proton tomographic set-ups on the spatial resolution, such as different combinations of entrance and exit coordinate and angle measurements, respectively, initial particle energy and angular confusion of the incident proton field. RESULTS: It was found that best spatial resolution is obtained by measuring in addition to the entrance and exit coordinates also the entrance and exit angles. However, by applying partial backprojection and by using a perfect proton fan beam a sufficient spatial resolution can be achieved with less experimental complexity (measuring only exit angles). It was also shown that it is essential to use the most probable proton trajectory to improve spatial resolution. A simple straight line connection for image reconstruction results in a spatial resolution which is not clinically sufficient. The percentage deterioration of spatial resolution due to the angular confusion of the incident proton field is less than the phase space in mrad. A clinically realistic proton beam with 10 mrad angular confusion results in a less than 10% loss of spatial resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically sufficient spatial resolution can be either achieved with a full measurement of entrance and exit coordinates and angles, but also by using a fan beam with small angular confusion and an exit angle measurement. It is necessary to use the most probable proton path for image reconstruction. A simple straight line connection is in general not sufficient. Increasing proton energy improves spatial resolution of an object of constant size. This should be considered in the design of proton therapy facilities.},

A second generation of dose application techniques, based on pencil beam scanning, is slowly being introduced into the commercially available proton therapy systems. New developments in accelerator physics are needed to accommodate and fully exploit these new techniques. At the same time new developments such as the development of small cyclotrons, Dielectric Wall Accelerator (DWA) and laser driven systems, aim for smaller, single room treatment units. In general the benefits of proton therapy could be exploited optimally when achieving a higher level in accuracy, beam energy, beam intensity, safety and system reliability. In this review an overview of the current developments will be given followed by a discussion of upcoming new technologies and needs, like increase of energy, on-line MRI and proton beam splitting for independent uses of treatment rooms.},

abstract = {The image quality of proton radiography using the method of beam energy modulation was studied to look into its practical uses. Two different depth-dose distributions generated by modulation were applied to investigate their effects on the density and spatial resolutions of the radiographic image. A steeper slope was found to provide higher resolution for the matching thickness of a phantom. The image was taken on a scintillation screen, and the distance between the phantom and the screen was a sensitive parameter on the resolution. For a beam with a range of 1.2 cm in Lucite, high-resolution images were attainable in the whole range. The resolution of proton images for different kinds of phantoms was examined in comparison with x-ray images as well as images simulated by a Monte Carlo code MCNPX. For a longer range of 18 cm, images attained by simulations indicated that density resolution is better maintained compared to spatial resolution, which is deteriorated by multiple Coulomb scattering.},

@article{Lecchi2008,
abstract = {New high-precision radiotherapy (RT) techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or hadrontherapy, allow better dose distribution within the target and spare a larger portion of normal tissue than conventional RT. These techniques require accurate tumour volume delineation and intrinsic characterization, as well as verification of target localisation and monitoring of organ motion and response assessment during treatment. These tasks are strongly dependent on imaging technologies. Among these, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US) and positron emission tomography (PET) have been applied in high-precision RT. For tumour volume delineation and characterization, PET has brought an additional dimension to the management of cancer patients by allowing the incorporation of crucial functional and molecular images in RT treatment planning, i.e. direct evaluation of tumour metabolism, cell proliferation, apoptosis, hypoxia and angiogenesis. The combination of PET and CT in a single imaging system (PET/CT) to obtain a fused anatomical and functional dataset is now emerging as a promising tool in radiotherapy departments for delineation of tumour volumes and optimization of treatment plans. Another exciting new area is image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), which focuses on the potential benefit of advanced imaging and image registration to improve precision, daily target localization and monitoring during treatment, thus reducing morbidity and potentially allowing the safe delivery of higher doses. The variety of IGRT systems is rapidly expanding, including cone beam CT and US. This article examines the increasing role of imaging techniques in the entire process of high-precision radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Treatment planning for proton tumor therapy requires a fast and accurate dose-calculation method. We have implemented a simplified Monte Carlo (SMC) method in the treatment planning system of the National Cancer Center Hospital East for the double-scattering beam delivery scheme. The SMC method takes into account the scattering effect in materials more accurately than the pencil beam algorithm by tracking individual proton paths. We confirmed that the SMC method reproduced measured dose distributions in a heterogeneous slab phantom better than the pencil beam method. When applied to a complex anthropomorphic phantom, the SMC method reproduced the measured dose distribution well, satisfying an accuracy tolerance of 3 mm and 3% in the gamma index analysis. The SMC method required approximately 30 min to complete the calculation over a target volume of 500 cc, much less than the time required for the full Monte Carlo calculation. The SMC method is a candidate for a practical calculation technique with sufficient accuracy for clinical application.},

@article{Hoekstra1987,
abstract = {Intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy (IORT) is a new combined modality therapy in the treatment of cancer. IORT is delivered during a surgical procedure to a tumor or tumor bed and areas of possible local regional spread, with the ability to shield or physically move normal tissues and organs out of the treatment volume. IORT is feasible for various intraabdominal, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and other malignancies. It is possible to increase the total radiation dose, thereby improving the therapeutic ratio; a better local control without an increasing morbidity. Although the optimum use of IORT is still unknown, it is believed that its greatest value is in combination with maximal surgical resection of the tumor with or without external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). IORT is still an experimental treatment modality combining surgery, EBRT, and if necessary, chemotherapy. Because IORT is an expensive treatment method, it is important to determine which method is the best and most convenient for the patient. The answer can be given only when prospective, randomized clinical IORT trials and cost-effectiveness studies are initiated.},

abstract = {The imaging sensitivity of proton radiography has been studied and compared with kV and MV x-ray imaging using Monte Carlo simulations. A phantom was specifically modeled using 21 different material inserts with densities ranging from 0.001 to 1.92 g cm(-3). These simulations were run using the MGH double scattered proton beam, scanned pencil proton beams from 200 to 490 MeV, as well as pure 50 keV, 100 keV, 1 MeV and 2 MeV gamma x-ray beams. In order to compare the physics implied in both proton and photon radiography without being biased by the current state of the art in detector technology, the detectors were considered perfect. Along with spatial resolution, the contrast-to-noise ratio was evaluated and compared for each material. These analyses were performed using radiographic images that took into account the following: only primary protons, both primary and secondary protons, and both contributions while performing angular and energetic cuts. Additionally, tissue-to-tissue contrasts in an actual lung cancer patient case were studied for simulated proton radiographs and compared against the original kV x-ray image which corresponds to the current patient set-up image in the proton clinic. This study highlights the poorer spatial resolution of protons versus x-rays for radiographic imaging purposes, and the excellent density resolution of proton radiography. Contrasts around the tumor are higher using protons in a lung cancer patient case. The high-density resolution of proton radiography is of great importance for specific tumor diagnostics, such as in lung cancer, where x-ray radiography operates poorly. Furthermore, the use of daily proton radiography prior to proton therapy would ameliorate patient set-up while reducing the absorbed dose delivered through imaging.},

The Monte Carlo simulations of proton beams passing through two thin targets and a water phantom were investigated to compare the primary and secondary proton fluence distributions and dosimetric differences among these codes. The angular fluence distributions, central axis depth-dose profiles, and lateral distributions of the Bragg peak cross-field were calculated to compare the proton angular and spatial distributions and energy deposition. Benchmark verifications from three different Monte Carlo simulations could be used to evaluate the residual proton fluence for the mean range and to estimate the depth and lateral dose distributions and the characteristic depths and lengths along the central axis as the physical indices corresponding to the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. The results showed a general agreement among codes, except that some deviations were found in the penumbra region. These calculated results are also particularly helpful for understanding primary and secondary proton components for stray radiation calculation and reference proton standard determination, as well as for determining lateral dose distribution performance in proton small-field dosimetry. By demonstrating these calculations, this work could serve as a guide to the recent field of Monte Carlo methods for therapeutic-energy protons."

ABSTRACT={More and more camera concepts are being investigated to try and seize the opportunity of instantaneous range verification of proton therapy treatments offered by prompt gammas emitted along the proton tracks. Focusing on one-dimensional imaging with a passive collimator, the present study experimentally compared in combination with the first, clinically-compatible, dedicated camera device the performances of instances of the two main options: a Knife-Edge Slit (KES) and a Multi-Parallel Slit (MPS) design. These two options were experimentally assessed in this specific context as they were previously demonstrated through analytical and numerical studies to allow similar performances in terms of Bragg peak retrieval precision and spatial resolution in a general context. Both collimators were prototyped according to the conclusions of Monte Carlo optimization studies under constraints of equal weight (40 mm tungsten alloy equivalent thickness) and of the specificities of the camera device under consideration (in particular 4 mm segmentation along beam axis and no time-of-flight discrimination, both of which less favorable to the MPS performance than to the KES one). Acquisitions of proton pencil beams of 100, 160 and 230 MeV in a PMMA target revealed that, in order to reach a given level of statistical accuracy on Bragg peak depth retrieval, the KES collimator requires only half the dose the present MPS collimator needs, making the KES collimator a preferred option for a compact camera device aimed at imaging only the Bragg peak position. On the other hand, the present MPS collimator proves more effective at retrieving the entrance of the beam in the target in the context of an extended camera device aimed at imaging the whole proton track within the patient.}
