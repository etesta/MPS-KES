Abstract Text

As the first Prompt Gammas (PG) cameras are deployed in clinical setting, we present a feasibility study of PG fall-off position (FOP) estimation on fully clinical simulations. The statistics required for a consistent FOP estimate is investigated for two PG detectors. A new spot-grouping method is proposed that combines better measurement statistics with fall-off preservation.Various proton clinics donated proton TPs for a study of typical spot weight distributions. A head and neck case with a CT and replanning (RP)CT was selected. A proton TP was constructed on the CT and irradiated on both CT and RPCT. During the irradiation, two PG cameras implemented according to their published specifications, recorded the PG profile. A FOP estimation algorithm is presented, and executed on 20 CT and 20 RPCT realizations to obtain a shift distribution. A selected spot has its weight modulated, in order to study shift distributions as function of the spot weight, for each camera. Then, a new dose-range based spot-grouping method is presented and evaluated.Spot weight averages are specific for each condition, and for cases where treatment verification is most pertinent, an average of order $10^7$ is found. Neither PG camera produces reliable FOP estimates with such statistics, even though the selected case exhibits significant morphological change. Only for $10^9$ primaries, with one of the cameras, the change may be expected to be detected. When spots are grouped, our method produces slightly better FOP estimation than energy-layer grouping.

Abstract Text

As the first Prompt Gammas (PG) cameras are deployed in clinical setting, we studied PG fall-off positions (FOP) estimation on a complete clinical simulations. The number of protons (spot weight) required for a consistent FOP estimate was investigated for two PG cameras, a multislit and knife edge design, for a single spot of a clinical fully clinical simulation of an patient treatment. A new spot-grouping method is proposed that combines better measurement statistics with fall-off preservation.

We considered a clinical head and neck treatment plan containing both a CT and re-planning (RP)CT. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed on both CTs. During the irradiation, two PG cameras implemented as published, recorded the PG profiles, spot by spot. We study shifted distributions as function of the spot weights, for each camera, from $10^6-10^9$. A FOP estimation was applied on 20 CT and 20 RPCT realizations to obtain FOP distributions for both images. A natural way to improve statistics is to integrate PG profiles over multiple spots. We investigate if and how spot-grouping methods improve FOP estimation.

By studying recent treatment plans from various proton clinics, we observe very few spots with weights over $10^8$. We did not manage to detect the morphological change present, an approximately 10mm shift, between the (RP)CT with either PG camera, with such statistics. Only for $10^9$ primaries, with one of the cameras, the change may be expected to be detected. Preliminary results of grouping spots in geometric layers seem to make an improved FOP estimation possible.
